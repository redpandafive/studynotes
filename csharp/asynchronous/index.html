      <h1>Asynchronous Programming</h1>

      <h2>Synchronous Programming</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Easier to read since code reads like a sequence of statements
            <ul>
              <li>Step by step instructions make it easier to understand</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Computer will block on each statement until the work is complete
            before moving on to the next statement
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bad practice to construct synchronous code to perform
                asynchronous operations
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            This ties the thread up waiting for the task to complete (database
            query, download, etc.)
            <ul>
              <li>
                This can take longer since that thread could be doing work
                somewhere else which some external operation completes
              </li>
              <li>
                This can freeze the UI on a client program since the thread is
                blocking
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Asynchronous Programming</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Frees up the thread to done something else while waiting on some
            asynchronous operation, such as a database query or web service call
          </li>
          <li>
            C# now has built in support for asynchronous programming
            <ul>
              <li>
                Without language support, the drawback is more complicated code
                requiring callbacks, events, etc
              </li>
              <li>Called a Task-based Asynchronous Pattern</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            You will want to use this anytime you have any I/O bound needs or
            expensive CPU bound code
            <ul>
              <li>Requesting data from a network</li>
              <li>Accessing a database</li>
              <li>Reading and writing to a file system</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Critical to distinguish between I/O bound and CPU bound operations
            since keyword usage is a bit different
            <ul>
              <li>I/O bound</li>
              <li>CPU bound</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Under the hood, C# creates a state machine</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Async Keyword</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Turns a method into an async method, which allows you to use the
            await keyword in its body
          </li>
          <li>
            Methods with this added must have an await keyword in their body
          </li>
          <li>
            Will run normally, but it is inefficient since you have the overhead
            of constructing the state machine
          </li>
          <li>
            Methods marked with this will return
            <ul>
              <li>
                Task – no return statement or a return statement that does not
                return an operand
              </li>
              <li>Task&lt;TResult&gt;</li>
              <li>
                As of C# 7, any return type that includes a GetAwaiter method
                (ValueTask is an example)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Await Keyword</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Provides a non-blocking way to start a task, then continue execution
            when that task completes
            <ul>
              <li>Designates a suspension point</li>
              <li>
                This isn’t an exit from the method and finally blocks don’t run
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            When applied, it
            <ul>
              <li>
                Yields control to the caller of the method that performed the
                await
              </li>
              <li>Resumes execution when the background job has finished</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Can only be used in an async method</li>
          <li>
            Arrange your code so this is applied at the moment you need the data
            from an asynchronous operation
            <ul>
              <li>
                Code between when a Task object is created and when the await
                keyword is applied will continue to execute
              </li>
              <li>
                In the code below, the GetStringAsync task will start on the
                first line, then DoSomeIndepenentWork will execute
              </li>
              <li>
                Execution will be suspended until GetStringAsync completes when
                it hits the await keyword
              </li>
              <li>Control will be returned to the caller in the meantime</li>
              <li>Control resumes when the GetStringAsync task completes</li>

                    HttpClient()).GetStringAsync(…some

      <h2>Task Objects</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Model asynchronous operations</li>
          <li>Used to model work being done in the background</li>
          <li>
            If you are not returning data, but want to use asynchronous code,
            return a Task object from the method (with no type)
          </li>
          <li>
            These are reference types, so they are created on the heap
            <ul>
              <li>
                Can use the ValueTask as a lightweight implementation of an
                generalized task-returning value
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Task.WhenAll</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Allows you to write code that performs non-blocking waits on
            multiple background jobs
          </li>
          <li>
            Creates a Task object that will complete when all the supplied tasks
            have completed
          </li>
          <li>Use this instead of Task.WaitAll</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Task.WhenAny</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Allows you to write code that performs non-blocking waits on
            multiple background jobs
          </li>
          <li>
            Creates a task object that will complete when any of the supplied
            tasks have completed
          </li>
          <li>
            Use this to start multiple tasks at the same time and process then
            one by one as they are completed
          </li>
          <li>Use this instead of Task.WaitAny</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>I/O Bound Work</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>waiting for something, such as data from a database</li>
          <li>Use async and await without Task.Run</li>
          <li>Should not use the Task Parallel Library</li>
          <li>
            This moves work to a background thread, but that doesn’t help at all
            when waiting on an external resource
          </li>
          <li>
            In a web server environment, the server will shift the thread to
            another request instead of block on the current one
          </li>
          <li>
            This does not create additional threads to use, so it does not
            require multithreading
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>CPU Bound Work</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>code is performing an expensive computation</li>
          <li>Use async and wait</li>
          <li>Also spawn off the work on another thread with Task.Run</li>
          <li>This moves the work to a background thread</li>
          <li>
            Use Task Parallel Library if the work is appropriate for concurrency
            and parallelism
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Additional Advice</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Be careful when mixing LINQ with asynchronous code since it uses
            deferred (lazy) execution
          </li>
          <li>End an async method name with Async by convention</li>
        </ul>
