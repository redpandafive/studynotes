      <h2>Vs Relational Databases</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Relational databases use a ledger (table) style structure to store things (people, addresses, phone numbers, etc)</li>
          <li>An <em>entity</em> (or thing you are interested) is generally stored as row</li>
          <li>
            Foreign key constrains represent relationships between to entities
            <ul>
              <li>If the value of the foreign key value matches both sides, they are related</li>
              <li>The constraint prevents you from setting up a value that does not have a match on the other side of the relationship</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Things are categories by the table that they are put in
            <ul>
              <li>Data that describes a person would be put in the Person table</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Relational databases are good if the data fits within the rigid structure and constraints are needed to prevent invalid direct relationships
            <ul>
              <li>Good to answer known and expected questions since data is constrained into a rigid structure and rule set</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Does not handle questions well that have not been anticipated when setting up the schema
            <ul>
              <li>Its unrealistic to expect to anticipate any question you may want to ask of your data</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Gets complex and rigid when representing relationships
            <ul>
              <li>Direct relationships are easy to represent</li>
              <li>
                Indirect relationships are hard = difficult to transverse across relationships
                <ul>
                  <li>Requires expensive joins upon joins</li>
                  <li>Frequently have to de-normalize, which ramps up challenges and complexity</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Graphs</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Simpler and more powerful, particularly when the meaning is in the relationships
            <ul>
              <li>"Dots and lines" = Nodes and Relationships</li>
              <li>
                Allows you to ask complex questions of your data that may not have been anticipated when the database was built
                <ul>
                  <li>"Find person who lives in Topeka, has two children, attended college, and bough a particular type of toaster</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>You can all more relationships as needed and still be performant</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            It is often easier to translate someones domain to a graph model instead of a relational model
            <ul>
              <li>The graph model is closer to how people would describe how their domain connects together</li>
              <li>Doesn't get bogged down with relational concepts, like normalization form, etc</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

      <h2>Nodes</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Simply put, an object in the graph
            <ul>
              <li>Also called Vertices or vertexes (in graph theory)</li>
              <li>Equivalent to rows in relational databases, instances in an entity relationship diagram</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Nodes have
            <ul>
              <li>
                Labels
                <ul>
                  <li>Tell you what type of thing it is</li>
                </ul>

              <li>
                Properties on them
                <ul>
                  <li>These are frequently key / value pairs</li>
                  <li>Can be through of as a Property container (can contain key / value metadata)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                A unique id number
                <ul>
                  <li>This is usually system generated</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Example node:
            <ul>
              <li>n: Person</li>
              <li>id: 1234</li>
              <li>first_name: "Ed"</li>

            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Relationships</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Relationships connect Nodes
            <ul>
              <li>Connect entities and structure domain = thought of as joins in relational databases</li>
              <li>Relate nodes by type and direction</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Also known as:
            <ul>
              <li>Relationship is the typical term used in graph databases</li>
              <li>Edges is the typical term in graph theory</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            In Neo4J, they:
            <ul>
              <li>Always fundamentally have a direction (can be transversed against the direction, however)</li>
              <li>Always have a label (allows you to transverse only certain types of relationships)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            These have
            <ul>
              <li>Type</li>
              <li>Direction = can be directional or bi-directional</li>

          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <h2>Labels</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>A semantic category that groups nodes by role</li>
          <li>Think of as the labels in an entity relationship diagram</li>
          <li>While it technically can be implemented as a Property, it is usually not recommended not to do this:
            <ul>
              <li>An optimized indexed way to scan to a particular subset</li>
              <li>In Cypher, they are a more performant way to reference nodes due to the database implementation</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            You can have multiple labels on the same node - queries that match at least one of them will be returned
          </li>
          <li>
            Labels are case sensitive
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Properties</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Entity attributes, relationship qualities, metadata
            <ul>
              <li>Key / value maps that can go on nodes and relationships</li>
              <li>Allows you to attach metadata to nodes and relationships</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            These express metadata about your nodes and relationships
          </li>
          <li>
            Keys are case sensitive

          <li>It is a declarative language
            <ul>
              <li>You do not tell the server how to get the data you want, only what data you want</li>
              <li>The database server determines the most optimal way based on a generated query plan</li>

            <li>MATCH = finds all nodes that have a type of Question</li>
            <li>ORDER BY = sorts the returned items by the order property in ascending order</li>
            <li>Returned items are assigned to the letter <code>q</code></li>
          </ul>
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <code> MATCH (q:Question) RETURN q ORDER BY q.order ASC <br /> </code>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          Example 2: Single Result
          <ul>
            <li>Only returns questions that have the specified unique id, so a guaranteed result set of one</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <code> MATCH (q:Question{field_id: 1874557}) RETURN q<br /> </code>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          Example 3: Query a Question that has at least one Answer
          <ul>
            <li>Only returns a question that has the specified unique id (<code>(q:Question{field_id: 1874557})</code>)</li>
            <li>This question should have a direct relationship of type HAS_ANSWER between a Question node and an Answer node</li>
            <li>The relationship should have a tail at the question node and a head at an answer node (dash and arrow characters)</li>
            <li>The returned question node is assigned to q</li>
            <li>The returned answer node is assigned to a</li>
            <li>This this is isolating the question to a single node (via the unique id), it basically returns all answers to that single question</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <code> MATCH (q:Question{field_id: 1874557})-[:HAS_ANSWER]->(a:Answer) RETURN q, a<br /> </code>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          Example 4: Query a Question that has at least one Answer and find the People who answered it
          <ul>
            <li>Tacks onto Example 3, so see that for explanation of first part of the query</li>
            <li>The returned question node is assigned to q</li>
            <li>It transverses a ANSWERED relationship to an Person node to find who answered the question</li>
            <li>Only return the first 200 matches</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <code> MATCH (q:Question{field_id: 1874557})-[:HAS_ANSWER]->(a:Answer)&lt;-[:ANSWERED]-(p:Person) RETURN a, p LIMIT 200<br /> </code>

          Example 5: Creating
          <ul>
            <li>The following query looks for sushi restaurants in New York that are liked by friends of Philip</li>
            <li>The code <code>person: Person</code> means a node with a label of 'Person' (<code>person</code> is the variable to represent the node)

      <h2>Constraints</h2>
      <section>
        <li>Neo4j does enforce a format schema, but there are ways to create unique constraints and indexes</li>
        <li>Constraints are used to 
          <ul>
            <li>Ensure uniqueness</li>
            <li>Allow fast lookup of nodes which match label-property pairs</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          There are three types of unique constraints:
          <ul>
            <li>Unique node property constraints</li>
            <li>Node property existence constraint
              <ul>
                <li>For instance, when creating a Person node, always require a property named name so a name is always specified</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Relationship property existence constraint
              <ul>
                <li>Requires a particular relationship to exist when creating a node</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <div>
          Here is how you create a unique constraint
          <ul>
            <li>Roughly equivalent to creating a primary key</li>
            <li>Forces the value of property to be unique</li>
            <li>Speeds up queries on this property since it can be indexed</li>
            <li>This is unique to the specified label, not the entire database</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <code>
                CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (label: Label) <br/>
                ASSERT label.property IS UNIQUE <br/>
              </code>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <h2>Indexes</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a declarative database language, this is how you hint to the database that it should consider this when building an execution plan
          </li>
          <li>
            In graph databases, indexes are only used finding the starting points for queries
            <ul>
              <li>Transversing out from a starting point Node is very cheap and fast, you aren't scanning and filtering massive record sets</li>
              <li>In relational databases, you use index scans to look up rows and join</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Indexes allow fast lookup of nodes which match label-property pairs</li>
          <li>Do not impose a constraint on properties that add the index to</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          Here is how you create an index on a property for nodes with the label of Label
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <code>
                CREATE INDEX ON :Label(property)
              </code>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <h2>MERGE</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Rough equivalent to UPSERT</li>
          <li>Create if it does not exist, otherwise do nothing</li>
          <li>This can be a stumbling block since it must match on all conditions; partial matches are considered not matched and the pattern will be creaed</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
