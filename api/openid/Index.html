      <h1>Open ID Connect</h1>

      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A simple identity layer on top of the OAuth2 protocol (extends the
            protocol)
            <ul>
              <li>Like OAuth 2, it is a set of rules or guidelines</li>
              <li>The standard does not include an implemenation</li>
              <li>Identity providers implement this standard - you dont want to code it yourself</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            A client application can request an identity token (next to an
            access token)
            <ul>
              <li>
                The identity token can be used to sign in to an application
              </li>
              <li>The access token is used to access the API</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            It supersedes OAuth2
            <ul>
              <li>Makes obsolete the less-good parts of OAuth2</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Can be used to secure web applications as well as APIs</li>
          <li>
            Security ASP.NET Core 6 with OAuth2 and OpenID Connect course
            recommendations
            <ul>
              <li>
                Open ID Connect is the superior protocol; it extends and
                supersedes OAuth2
              </li>
              <li>Once you deal with users, use Open ID Connect</li>
            </ul>

      <h2>How It Works - Very High Level</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The details of this communication can vary depending on the flow
            <ul>
              <li>The access token is determined by the flow that is used</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Client application (also called relying party) creates a request
            that redirects the user to the identity provider
          </li>
          <li>
            At the level of the identity provider, the user proves who they are
            <ul>
              <li>Usually by providing a username and password</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If approved, the identity provider creates an identity token, signs
            it, and returns it to the client application
            <ul>
              <li>This token provides the user's verifyable identity</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Client validates the token and now has proof of identity</li>
          <li>
            In ASP.NET Core, this identity token is used to create a
            ClaimsIdentity
            <ul>
              <li>
                In most cases, this is an authentication ticket stored in an
                encrypted cookie
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Client Types</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client credentials are typically a client id and a client secret
            <ul>
              <li>These are not the same as user credentials</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>There are two categories of clients</li>
          <li>
            Confidential
            <ul>
              <li>
                Client capable of maintaining the confidentiality of their
                credentials (client id and client secret)
              </li>
              <li>
                Client credientials can be stored at the level of the client
                application
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    An example of this is a web app that runs on a web server,
                    such as an ASP.NET Core web application
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Credentials are stored on the server and not exposed to or
                accessable by user
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Public
            <ul>
              <li>Clients not capable to maintaining confidentiality</li>
              <li>
                Example would be an application that executing in a browser on
                the client, such as JavaScript applications or Web Assembly apps
              </li>
              <li>
                Secrets cannot be stored in the client application since the
                user has access to it
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Open ID Connect Flow</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A flow is a set of HTTP requests and responses that determine how
            code(s) and/or tokens are safely delivered to clients
          </li>
          <li>
            Very simple cases are a single request and response, but it usually
            more complicated than that
          </li>
          <li>
            Different flows will be used, depending on:
            <ul>
              <li>The client type being used</li>
              <li>Lifetime requirements</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            TLS is required for OIDC
            <ul>
              <li>Traffic must always be encrypted</li>
              <li>
                Tokens are not encrypted out of the box since OIDC relies on
                transport layer to care care of encryption
              </li>
              <li>
                Without it, you are vulnerable to man in the middle attacks
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Flows talk to different endpoints
            <ul>
              <li>
                Authorization endpoint (IDP level)
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Used by the client applicaiton to obtain authentication for
                    identity tokens and/or authorizaiton for access token
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This is done by redirecting the client to the identtiy
                    provider
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Redirection endpoint (client level)
                <ul>
                  <li>Also called callback endpoint</li>
                  <li>
                    This is the URI that the identity provider redirects the
                    client back to
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Used by the identity provider to return code & token(s) to
                    the client application
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Token endpoint (IDP level)
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Client applications can programatically request tokens
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Used by client applications to request tokens without
                    redirection
                    <ul>
                      <li>Typically done via HTTP POST without redirection</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Requests can be authenticated (for confidential clients) or
                    not (for public clients)
                  </li>
                </ul>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            There are three OpenID Connect flows
            <ul>
              <li>
                Authorization Code
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Recommended for both Condidential clients and Public clients
                    <ul>
                      <li>Use along with PKCE protection</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Returns an authorizaiton code from the authorization
                    endpoint
                    <ul>
                      <li>This is a short lived, single use credential</li>
                      <li>
                        Used to verify that the user logged in at the level of the IDP is the same one
                        who started the flow at the client application level
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    For confidential clients
                    <ul>
                      <li>Request to the token endpoint should be authenticated</li>
                      <li>Allows the use of long lived tokens through the user of a refresh token</li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Long lived accss is restricted since public clients cannot store their authentication informaiton</li>
                      <li>Current consensus is move away from handling security at level of the client in favor of the server</li>
                      <li>Let the site that hosts your use agent based app (Angular, Blazor, React) handle the Open ID connect flow
