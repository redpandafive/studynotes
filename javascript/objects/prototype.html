      <h1>Prototypes and Prototype Inheritance</h1>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            JS uses the term "own property" to refer to non-inherited properties
          </li>
          <li>
            Almost every JS object has a second JS object associated with it
            known as a prototype
            <ul>
              <li>Objects inherit the properties from its prototype</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            All objects created by object literals have the same prototype
            object
            <ul>
              <li>Use <code>Object.prototype</code> to refer to this object</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Objects created with the new keyword and a constructor invocation
            are different
            <ul>
              <li>
                The value of the prototype property of the constructor function
                is their prototype
              </li>
              <li>
                Object created by <code>new Object()</code> inherits from
                Object.prototype (like {})
              </li>
              <li>
                Object created by <code>new Array()</code> inherits from
                Date.prototype (like {})
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Prototype chain = linked series of prototype objects</li>
          <li>
            The prototype chain is searched for looking for a property
            <ul>
              <li>
                When querying for a property on an object x, it first checks
                "its own properties"
              </li>
              <li>
                If not found there, the prototype object of x is checked for the
                property.
              </li>
              <li>
                If not found there and there is a prototype object, check that
                for the property
              </li>
              <li>
                This continues until the property is found or an object with a
                null prototype is searched
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Inheritance occurs when querying properties, but not setting them
            <ul>
              <li>
                Making an assignment to a prototype property creates a property
                on the outermost object
              </li>
              <li>It will never make an assignment to a prototype property.</li>
              <li>
                This allows us to selectively override inherited properties.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you add a property to an object that has the same name as a
                property on the prototype, it only hides the property on the
                prototype.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Inheritance is dynamic
            <ul>
              <li>Properties modified after creation are still inherited</li>
              <li>
                Useful for adding new language features in older versions of the
                language
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Must be careful with this since it can lead to future
                    incompatibility and confusion
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Could even add to <code>Object.prototype</code>, but this
                    usually is not a good idea
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
