      <h1>Set Theory</h1>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>A branch of mathematics devotes to collections of elements, or sets</li>
          <li>Sets can be described by:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Enumerating the elements it contains: 
                <ul>
                  <li>{a,b,c}</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Stating a rule to determine which elements belong in the set
                <ul>
                  <li>{x &#8712; S | P(x)}</li>
                  <li>"The set of all elements x belonging in set S such that P of x"</li>
                  <li>P function is called predicate and selects elements that belong to the set
                    <ul>
                      <li>It is the constraint that every element must fulfill in order to qualify as a member in the set</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Once a set is defined, elements can be described as members or not members of the set
            <ul>
              <li>a &#8712; {a, b, c}</li>
              <li>d &#8713; {a, b, c}</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            A set is a subset of another set if, and only if, every element of the first set is also an element of the second set
            <ul>
              <li>When all items in one set exist in the other set, then the first is a subset of the second</li>
              <li>{a, b} &#8838; {b, a}</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Given two sets, if there is at least one element in the second set that does not exist in the first set, then
            <ul>
              <li>The first (smaller) set is a proper subset of the second (larger) set</li>
              <li>
                The second set (larger) is a superset of the first (smaller) set
              </li>
              <li>{a, b} &#8834; {a, b, c}</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Two sets are considered equal if, and only if, they contain the same elements:
            <ul>
              <li>Every member of the first set is also a member of the second set</li>
              <li>Every member of the second set is also a member of the first set</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            A set is not a subset of another set if there exists at least one element in the first set that is not a member of the second set
            <ul>
              <li>Overlapping sets contain at least one element in both sets</li>
              <li>Disjoint sets contain no elements that are in both the first and second sets</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The empty set is a special case set
            <ul>
              <li>Symbolized as &#8709;</li>
              <li>Contains nothing.  It itself is not nothing, rather it is a container of nothing</li>
              <li>Given two sets that are disjoint, the elements common to both is the empty set</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The universal set is the set that every set is a subset of, and that every element is a member of
            <ul>
              <li>Symbolized by &#8746;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
