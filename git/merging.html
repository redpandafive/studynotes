          <li>Allows you to incorporate changes from one branch into another</li>
          <li>Unlike TFS, a merge ends with a commit, so there will be no outstanding changes remaining in working directory</li>
          <li>
            Source branch has the changes that you want to incorporate into the target
            <ul>
              <li>This branch is not modified</li>
              <li>The head pointer will not move after the merge</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Target branch you want to modify by merging changes into
            <ul>
              <li>This branch is the only one modified</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Fast Forward Merge</h2>
      <section id="fastforward">
        <ul>
          <li>This can be performed when there are no changes made on the source since the target branch was split from it</li>
          <li>The head of the target branch is changed to point to the the last commit on the source branch</li>
          <li>Now both the source and target branch heads will point to the same commit</li>
          <li>When you run the merge command, the output will indicate if the merge was fast-forward</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Conflicts</h2>
      <section id="conflicts">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Conflicts occur in merges when you have changes to the same line of code in the same file of both branches
            <ul>
              <li>Git needs you to decide how to combine the changes before the merge can be finished</li>
              <li>These must be manually resolved before you can commit</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a [routerLink]="['./branching']"><kbd>git diff</kbd></a> can be useful when you have conflicts
          </li>
          <li>
            Git will put all of the contents from both versions into a single file and open it in the default editor
            <ul>
              <li>It will add file markers that indicate the conflicting changes</li>
              <li>You must edit this file to combine the content</li>
              <li>When finished, add and commit the changes to create a merge commit</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            A merge commit has 2 parent commits, one from each side of the merge
            <ul>
              <li>When resolving a conflict that has two parents, make sure to remove file markers when you are editing and committing</li>
              <li>Only the target branch will change. The source branch will remain the same</li>
              <li>
                If you want both branches to be updated, you must run the merge on both branches
                <ul>
                  <li><kbd>git switch colors2.0</kbd></li>
                  <li><kbd>git merge main</kbd></li>
                  <li><kbd>git switch main</kbd></li>
                  <li><kbd>git merge colors2.0</kbd></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>When updating both branches, the second merge will be a fast-forward merge</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            In CLI, this will open the default editor and you will see syntax similar to the following
            <div class="card">
              <div class="card-body">
                <code> &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD&#10;8 Granny Smith apples&#10;======&#10;1 tablespoon cinnamon&#10;10 Granny Smith apples&#10;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ideas" </code>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>Above the ====== is from the source branch, marked as HEAD</li>
          <li>Below the ====== is from the target branch, the branch you are merging into. Marked by the branch name</li>
          <li>To correct, modify the text to the way it should read to resolve (remove head references too)</li>
          <li>Afterwards, stage and commit (Git will supply a suitable message)</li>
          <li>
            During a merge commit
            <ul>
              <li>Before staging merge changes, <kbd>git status</kbd> will tell you "You have unmerged paths"</li>
              <li>After staging merge changes, <kbd>git status</kbd> will tell you "All conflicts fixed but you are still merging"</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>There may be several conflicts that you should resolve one at a time. Beware of the evil merge (see in Best Practices)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Bailing out of a Merge</h2>
      <section id="bailingout">
        <ul>
          <li>When you need to bail out of a merge, use the merge command with the abort parameter</li>
          <li>
            This will stop the merge and return the directory to the previous state
            <b>BEFORE THE MERGE BEGAN</b>
          </li>

          <li><kbd>git merge --abort</kbd></li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <section id="bestpractices">
        <ul>
          <li>When you split off a branch and know you must merge that new branch back into its source, pull updates from the source frequently to minimize time spent on conflict resolutions</li>
          <li>
            Evil merge
            <ul>
              <li>Introduces new content into a merge, such as changing content that isn't related to a merge conflict</li>
              <li>You can't trace this change back to one of the two commits in the merge</li>
              <li>This can be confusing since there is no context where it came from or why its there.</li>
              <li>This may occur if you are midway through resolving conflicts and realize something is missing</li>
              <li>Instead, you should abort the merge, add the content, then start the merge again</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Scenario Descriptions</h2>
      <section id="scenarios">
        <ul>
          <li>
            From branch a, branch into b, add a new file, then merge b into a
            <ul>
              <li>Results in both branches having similar log output</li>
              <li>Both point to the same commits (therefore, same trees and nodes)</li>
              <li>To perform the merge, Git added the commit from b as the tip of a, then set both head pointers and HEAD to this commit</li>
            </ul>

      <h2>Cherry Picking</h2>
      <section id="cherry">
        <ul>
          <li>Useful when you want to bring over a single commit to another branch</li>
          <li>
            This only creates a copy - the original commit is not changed, removed, or altered in any way
            <ul>
              <li>This will create a new commit on the target branch, so the commit object that shows up with have a different SHA ID</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Advanced feature that should not be used to replace merging</li>
          <li><kbd>git cherry-pick</kbd> appends any commit to the head of the branch you are currently working on</li>
          <li>
            Common use cases
            <ul>
              <li>
                Applying a bug fix that applies to multiple versions of the product
                <ul>
                  <li>Assume different versions of the product are on different branches</li>
                  <li>Create the fix on a single branch</li>
                  <li>Cherry pick the commit to the other branches to apply the fix to them</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Useful to capture specific commits from an inactive branch</li>
              <li>Useful when you need a feature from another branch but the branches are not ready to merge yet</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>This can cause duplicate commits in multiple branches and can confuse someone if they are not aware of the pick</li>
          <li>
            Steps and commands
            <ul>
              <li>
                Find the commit you want to pick - need to find the SHA ID and copy it
                <ul>
                  <li><kbd>git log --oneline</kbd> = use to find the commit you want from the current branch</li>
                  <li><kbd>git log xxxx --oneline</kbd> = list the log from another branch</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Checkout the target branch
                <ul>
                  <li><kbd>git checkout xxxx</kbd> = assuming branch xxxx is the target, checkout that branch</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Perform the cherry pick to append the specified commit to the HEAD (head of current branch)
                <ul>
                  <li><kbd>git cherry-pick xxxxxx</kbd> = assuming SHA ID of xxxxxx</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

          <li>
