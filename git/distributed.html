          <li>Git repositories can be cloned and they are all on equal footing</li>
          <li>Differs from centralized VCS where clients only talk to a central server</li>
          <li>All repository clones can synchronize with any other</li>
          <li>
            In practice, you will probably have designated one repository as the reference repo
            <ul>
              <li>Could have multiple developers, each with their own clone</li>
              <li>Developers would synchronize with a designated central clone</li>
              <li>Builds would be sourced from this "central" repository</li>
              <li>This is more of a workflow issue, not a technical one</li>

      <h2>Cloning</h2>
      <section id="cloning">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use to create a local copy of a repository from a remote repository using a URL
            <ul>
              <li>This contains the entire history for the main branch</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            This command does the following
            <ul>
              <li>Creates an empty directory for the project</li>
              <li>Deep copies the .git directory and all the files it contains into this new directory</li>
              <li>Checks out the local main branch and loads the files into the working area</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            By default, this will only copy the main branch
            <ul>
              <li>Will not include every file in the .git directory since only files associated with the main branch are copied</li>
              <li>Must specify a different branch if you need something other than main</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <kbd>git clone https://github.com/nusco/how-git-works</kbd>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Fetch vs Pull</h2>
      <section id="fetchvspull">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fetch
            <ul>
              <li>Only downloads branches, tags, and objects from a remote repository and does not integrate this new data into your working files or local repository</li>
              <li>Good for getting a fresh view on things that happened on the remote repository</li>
              <li>Use to see all the current branches and changes in your remote repository</li>
              <li>Cannot fetch enough since it will not destroy or mess things up</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Pull
            <ul>
              <li>Downloads branches, tags, and objects from a remote and updates the local repository to match the remotes content</li>
              <li>Integrates new data into your working copy files</li>
              <li>This may cause a conflict with the local files, so you may need to handle the merge conflict</li>
              <li>Use only when you have a clean working copy with no uncommitted local changes</li>
              <li>Think of a pull as a fetch and merge</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Remote Repositories</h2>
      <section id="remote">
        <ul>
          <li>AKA Remotes</li>
          <li>This is a location where the project is hosted - could be a service such as GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab or an internal server</li>
          <li>
            This serves as a reference for the state of the project
            <ul>
              <li>Used for tracing milestones, testing, and/or code reviews</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Cloning a repository creates a separate copy repository on your local computer
            <ul>
              <li>When cloning a repository, all files in the .git folder are copied to the local computer</li>
              <li>Remotes will usually have an associated URL that you can use to create a clone</li>
              <li>
                <kbd>git clone https://github.com/seethatgodemo/widgit.git</kbd>
                <ul>
                  <li>Pulls the code from the URL</li>
                  <li>Sets up a local main branch that tracks the remote main branch</li>
                  <li>Use <kbd>git remote -v</kbd> to see the URL your cloned from</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                By convention, the source remote repository is called origin
                <ul>
                  <li>This address is stored in the repository configuration file</li>

                  <li>The configuration file can store references to other clones of the repository (.git/config) that you may want to synchronize with</li>
                  <li>
                    To manually add a remote, use
                    <kbd>git remote add remoteName remoteUrl</kbd>
                    <ul>
                      Name will be the local identifier, such as origin
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>You can have as many remotes as you want referenced in the file</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The local repository will also track the branches on remote Repositories
            <ul>
              <li>This is automatically updated when you connect to a remote</li>
              <li><kbd>git branch --all</kbd> will display all branches, including remote ones</li>
              <li>This also shows the current position of HEAD</li>
              <li>
                These are tracked the same way a local branches, as files stored in the .git/refs/remotes folder
                <ul>
                  As an optimization, these may instead be put in the packed-refs files
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Like a local branch, a remote branch is just a reference to a commit</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Multi-User Environment</h2>
      <section id="multiuser">
        <ul>
          <li>When multiple developers are working on a project, each developer will have their own local copy of a repository. A central remote repository is the authority version</li>
          <li>
            You can push a branch from your local repository to the remote Repository
            <ul>
              <li>This will allow others to see your branch on the remote repository</li>
              <li>Useful if you need to switch development machines and continue to work on the project</li>
              <li>Troubleshooting and code reviews are the scenarios where this could be used</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Steps to transfer a WIP branch to another computer
            <ul>
              <li>Use <kbd>git remote -v</kbd> to see the list of remotes and their URLs in your local configuration</li>
              <li>
                Push the feature4 branch to remote using
                <kbd>git push -u origin feature4</kbd>
              </li>
              <li>Verify branch using <kbd>git ls-remote</kbd> to view all the branches on remote</li>
              <li>Use <kbd>git fetch origin feature4</kbd> to fetch the feature4 branch from remote to local</li>
              <li><kbd>git checkout --track origin/feature4</kbd> to setup a local branch to track the remote branch</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Team conventions that can Help
            <ul>
              <li>Have a shared .gitignore file in the root of the project so all team members use it</li>
              <li>README.md for important information (markdown)</li>
              <li>Frequent smaller commits are easier to manage than one giant commit</li>
              <li>In the event of large refactors, renames, and/reformats, coordinate with all users who may have branches in flight</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Commit tips
            <ul>
              <li>Commit related changes</li>
              <li>Don't commit half fixes of two unrelated things - ask if the commit makes sense on its own</li>
              <li>
                Use a good subject line for a commit message
                <ul>
                  <li>Does it answer the question of what the commit does</li>
                  <li>Try an keep at 50 characters or less</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Add a body to your commit when it is appropriate
                <ul>
                  <li>May need to provide more context as to why the change was made</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Merge tips
            <ul>
              <li>Update from remote before attempting a merge</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't break the build
            <ul>
              <li>Automated build servers will periodically build project code and run automated tests to verify code integrity</li>
              <li>Avoid errors by building code on a local machine before merging with remote</li>
              <li>Run unit tests locally and fix any errors or failures before attempting a merge</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid commented out code
            <ul>
              <li>As long as the code is committed, Git will remember it</li>
              <li>Use the history feature of Git instead of littering up the code base with commented out code</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Whitespace differences
            <ul>
              <li>
                Whitespace differences matter to Git
                <ul>
                  <li>Not having this can lead to piles of changes that are only due to whitespace differences - drowns out real code changes</li>
                  <li>Have all team members use a unified, consistent formatting standard in their IDE</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Different line endings can show up in different operating systems
                <ul>
                  <li>Pick a line ending and enforce it</li>
                </ul>

      <h2>Synchronizing Repositories</h2>
      <section id="syncingRepositories">
        <ul>
          <li>All objects in a Git repository are immutable and have a unique hash identifier</li>
          <li>Therefore, synchronizing with another repository just needs to send all missing files to the other repository</li>
          <li>To synchronize, use the <kbd>git push</kbd> command where there are no conflicts</li>
          <li>
            This gets complicated when multiple people are pushing commits to the remote. You could end up with a conflict if there has been a commit since the last time you synchronized
            <ul>
              <li>Git will not allow you to push if there are conflicts with the remote</li>
              <li>You must resolve conflicts first, then push</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            NOT RECOMMENDED APPROACH TO SOLVE - you could force a push using
            <kbd>git push -f</kbd> and force the remote to synchronize with your changes
            <ul>
              <li>However, the commits the other developer added will be orphaned and eventually garbage collected</li>
              <li>This puts the burden of fixing the conflict on another developer</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            RECOMMENDED APPROACH - resolve the conflict on your local machine before pushing
            <ul>
              <li>
                Steps in this sequence
                <ul>
                  <li>Use <kbd>git fetch</kbd> to get the new objects</li>
                  <li>Since we are only adding new objects with this, we will not loose the local changes</li>
                  <li>Use <kbd>git merge origin/main</kbd> in your own repository to resolve any conflicts</li>
                  <li>Finally, push the resolved changes to the server</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                This is such a common operation, it is consolidated into a operation called Pull
                <ul>
                  <li>This is a fetch followed by a merge</li>
                  <li>Therefore, first you push, then you push</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <section id="bestpractices">
        <ul>
          <li>
            As a general rule, NEVER rebase shared commits
            <ul>
              <li>You can perform them on changes that have not been shared yet</li>
