            Effectively a way to rewrite the history of your project
            <ul>
              <li>
                Not a common feature among VCS and Git is by far the most
                popular that supports it
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Reapplies commits on top of another base tip, leaving a single,
            linear history
          </li>
          <li>
            Provides an alternative to merging to consolidate the history of two
            branches
          </li>
          <li>
            Scenarios where it is useful
            <ul>
              <li>
                Used as an alternative to merges
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Merge commits are created automatically by Git to cram in
                    all the differing changes. They can be a messy spot in an
                    otherwise meticulously maintained history.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Rebasing allows you to take changes that were committed on
                    one branch and replay them on another branch
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Cleaning up your local history before sharing a branch
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Multiple commits can be squashed into a single commit to
                    keep the history focused and clear
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Allows you to pull changes from a branch into your branch
                without performing a merge
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Useful if you want to maintain a linear project history
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            As a general rule, NEVER rebase shared or public branches
            <ul>
              <li>
                You can perform them on changes that have not been shared yet
              </li>
              <li>You should never rebase on a public branch</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Teams may decide to never rebase, so check your team guidelines
          </li>
          <li>
            Important to remember that rebase actually creates copies of the
            commits so it can repoint the parent references
            <ul>
              <li>
                Previous commit objects will be orphaned and eventually be
                garbage collected
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

      <h2>Rebasing Modes</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There are two rebase modes
            <ul>
              <li>
                Standard
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Automatically grabs the commits present in your current
                    working branch and immediately appplies them to the head of
                    the passed branch
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Interactive
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Lets you change different commits in the process instead of
                    just grabbing everything and tossing it into the passed
                    branch
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Gives you a chance to remove, split, or alter existing
                    comments and clean up history
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

      <h2>Merging Review</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Start with two seperated branches
            <p>
              <img src="../../../assets/rebasing-0.png" />
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            A merge will combine the changes from both branches into a single
            commit
            <ul>
              <li>
                The new commit's parents will be the former heads of the main
                and spaghetti branches
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If the merge is issued on the spaghetti <kbd>git merge main</kbd>
            <ul>
              <li>The spaghetti head will point to the new commit</li>
              <li>
                The main head will not move and will remain at the commit it was
                on at the time of the commit
              </li>
            </ul>

      <h2>Merging vs Rebasing</h2>
      <section>
        <p>These two approaches have different trade-offs</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Merges
            <ul>
              <li>
                Preserves history exactly as it happened (merges never lie)
              </li>
              <li>
                Becomes difficult to follow when there is lots of branching and
                merging
              </li>
              <li>
                <kbd>git log</kbd> output can become misleading since it
                flattens seperate timelines into a single linear output
              </li>
              <li>
                This should be the default unless you really know what you are
                doing
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Rebases
            <ul>
              <li>
                Timeline is simpler since all commits are arranged in a single
                line
              </li>
              <li>Allows streamlining history so it looks cleaner</li>
              <li>
                <kbd>git log</kbd> is more compatible with this since it doesn't
                have to represent seperate timelines
              </li>
              <li>
                However, rebases refactor history
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Is not an accurate representation of the true history of the
                    project
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Commits may not end up in the order they were actually
                    submitted to the repository
                  </li>
                  <li>This can interfere with some advanced Git commands</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                It is also a destrucive process and may leave behind orphaned
                commits that are inaccessable and will be garbage collected
              </li>
              <li>
                Recommended to use merges as a default unless you know what you
                are doing and understand the consequences of a rebase
              </li>
            </ul>

      <h2>Simple Branch Rebasing</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This will rearrange the branches so they look like a single branch
          </li>
          <li>
            Git looks for the first commit that is in both main and spaghetti
            branches
            <p><img src="../../../assets/rebasing-2.png" /></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Git "detaches" the entire spaghetti branch from this commit
            <ul>
              <li>
                This is not technically correct since objects are immutable -
                see Rebasing Details
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><img src="../../../assets/rebasing-3.png" /></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Next, it "moves" the entire spaghetti branch to attach to the head
              of main
            </p>
            <p><img src="../../../assets/rebasing-4.png" /></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            This changes the base of this branch; the first blue dot's parent
            will point to the last red dot
            <ul>
              <li>
                The spaghetti branch now contains all the commits of the main
                branch and the spaghetti branch
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            If you rebase spaghetti into main after this (<kbd
              >git rebase spaghetti</kbd
            >),
            <ul>
              <li>
                Git will figure out it just needs to fast-forward the branch
              </li>
              <li>
                The main head will point to the same commit as the spaghetti
                head
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If you did a merge operation instead, the exact same action would be
            done
            <ul>
              <li>
                Result would be all commits made on main and spaghetti in the
                same history
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><img src="../../../assets/rebasing-5.png" /></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Remember that rebasing is an opertion that creates one or more new
            commits
          </li>
          <li>
            Objects in the Git database are immutable, so the process outlined
            above is not technically correct
            <ul>
              <li>
                To perform a rebase, Git must make copies of the a_branch nodes
                with different parent pointers
              </li>
              <li>
                Since the contents of the commit objects have changed (with
                different parent references), they will be new files with new
                hashes
              </li>
              <li>The a_branch head be moved</li>
            </ul>
            <figure><img src="../../../assets/rebasing-6.png" /></figure>
          </li>
          <li>
            As a consequence, the two blue nodes from the original a_branch
            remain in the object database
            <ul>
              <li>
                However, no head pointers reference them anymore and the CLI
                will not display them in any output.
              </li>
              <li>
                Unless you remember their hashes, you cannot view them anymore
                (unless you dig into the actual files in the database)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Git will periodically garbase collect unreachable objects
            <ul>
              <li>These unreachable commits will eventually be deleted</li>
            </ul>

      <h2>Syncing with Main using Rebase</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Suppose you are working on a branch called solution and you want to
            update the solution branch with any changes that have gone into main
            since you branched off it.
            <figure>
              <img src="../../../assets/rebasing-sync-1.png" />

            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>
            Rebasing can pull over the changes from main, then replay the
            commits that are in the solution branch on top of the changes from
            main
            <figure>
              <img src="../../../assets/rebasing-sync-2.png" />

            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>
            Looking a the log, commits for the solution branch now appear after
            the new commits in main

          <li>
            This helps sequence your changes with main and make a more linear
            history when you merge back into main
          </li>
          <li>
            Remember, this creates copies of your commits so it can change the

          <li>
            If you have multiple commits in your local history, you can squash
            them down before merging with a public branch to make the history
            cleaner

          <li>
            What Git actually does is create a new commit and combines all
            comments from each commit. This will appear as one commit in your
            history.

              <li>
                Run the rebase command and specify the commit you want to squash

              </li>
              <li>
                Git will open the default text editor listing the commits to be

              <li>
                Edit the text file with each action to take on each commit:
                <ul>
                  <li>p, pick - pic this commit to keep</li>
                  <li>s, squash - squash this commit into a previous commit</li>

                Git will open the editor that contains all commit messages for
                all commits. You can edit these or add something entirely new.

              <li>
                Save and close the editor - this results in a new single commit
                that includes the changes of the two previous commits

            Using interactive mode, you can edit the history of a set of commits
            by using the following commands
            <ul>
              <li>p, pick - pic this commit to keep</li>
              <li>e, edit - edit this commit to amend the commit message</li>
              <li>r, reword - use this commit, but also edit it</li>
              <li>s, squash - squash this commit into a previous commit</li>
              <li>d, drop - delete this commit</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
