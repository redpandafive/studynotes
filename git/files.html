      <h2>Four Types of Files in Git</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Blobs</li>
          <li>Trees</li>
          <li>Commits</li>
          <li>Annotated Tags</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Stages of a File</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Untracked
            <ul>
              <li>
                Files that are not part of the Git repository, but found in the
                project directory
              </li>
              <li>
                Untracked files that are added to the project will be in the
                Staged state at first.
              </li>
              <li>
                These will stay in the directory no matter which branch you are
                in
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Tracked
            <ul>
              <li>Tracked files can be in one of three states</li>
              <li>
                Committed
                <ul>
                  <li>Data is stored in the repository</li>
                  <li>
                    There have been no modifications since the last commit
                    snapshot
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When a committed file is changed, it is moved to the
                    Modified state
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    These files belong to the branch where the git commit was
                    run
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Modified
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The file has changed, but changed have not been recorded in
                    the repository
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Once you have finished modifying a file, you must move it to
                    a Staged status for commit
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Staged
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A file that has been modified and you have identified that
                    you want to move those files to the repository on the next
                    commit
                  </li>
                  <li>Once committed, files go back to a Committed status</li>
                  <li>
                    If these have not been committed before, these files will
                    stay in the staged state when switching branches
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

      <h2>Three Main Parts of a Git Project</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Working Directory
            <ul>
              <li>Holds a checkout of the project from .git directory</li>
              <li>Files can be modified here</li>
              <li>
                Changes that should be sent in the next commit must first be
                sent to the staging area - otherwise they will not be included.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Staging Area
            <ul>
              <li>Also known as Index</li>
              <li>
                Used to build a up a change or set of changes that will sent in
                the next commit
              </li>
              <li>
                Only changes in staging area are sent in a commit, not all
                changes in the working directory
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            .git Directory
            <ul>
              <li>Aka Repository</li>
              <li>
                Origin of project data - this is what is pulled down from a
                remote server when copying a repository
              </li>
              <li>Stores metadata, objects for projects</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Commands</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <kbd>git show xxxxxx</kbd>
            <ul>
              <li>Displayes contents of the object with identifier xxxxxx</li>
              <li>
                For tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects
              </li>
              <li>For trees, it shows the names</li>
              <li>For plain blobs, it shows the plain contents</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

      </section>

      <h2>.gitignore File</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            File where you can tell Git to ignore certain files
            <ul>
              <li>
                These are files generated by code base, such as compiled code,
                log files, individual IDE setting files
              </li>
              <li>
                Ignored files are not added to branchs, so they will not
                disappear and reappear when you switch branches
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Good practice for a team to have a shared .gitignore file so
            everyone is on the same page
          </li>
          <li>This should go in the project root</li>
          <li>
            Syntax - uses uses regular expression-esque syntax to express
            patterns of files to ignore
            <ul>
              <li>* = one or more wildcard (except slash)</li>
              <li>? = single character wildcard (except slash)</li>
              <li>! = negator</li>
              <li>
                / = directory seperator
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    These are evaluated relative to the directory where
                    .gitignore resides
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>[a-zA-Z] = range of all alphabetic characters</li>
              <li># will prefix comments</li>
              <li>
                ** will match any directory in the repository
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    **/bin will ignore any bin directory in the repository
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                *.zip to match any filename in the repository (this ignores any
                zip file)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>

      <h2>Exclude Files For Your System Only</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The .git/info/exclude file will exclude files on your local
            repository only
          </li>
          <li>Uses same syntax as the .gitignore file</li>
