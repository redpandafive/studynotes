            Branches are independent, seperate lines of development on which you
            can code

                Allow you to try out new ideas and experiment without risking
                your established code base

              <li>
                Think of as a lightweight, movable pointer reference to a commit

      <h2>Workflow with Branching</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use seperate branches to experiment with ideas and keep failed
            experimental branches until you have a solution that works
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create a new branch when you want to try something, but not sure
                if it is going to work
              </li>
              <li>
                If it doesn't work, don't throw away the changes. Commit the
                changes in case there is a piece that may be useful later
              </li>
              <li>
                start over using a new branch from the original source to get a
                clean start
              </li>
              <li>
                If you find there was code in the failed branch that can be
                useful, you can easily retrieve it and copy/paste since you have
                preserved that branch
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If you just undo a failed experiement, then you lose all the
                    code
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Seperate branches can also be used if you have a feature where
            development has to be paused for some reason
            <ul>
              <li>
                You can create a new branch and continue working on an different
                feature
              </li>
              <li>
                When you are ready to resume work on the first feature, switch
                over to that branch
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When you create a repository, you automatically get a default branch
            named either main or master
            <ul>
              <li>Older versions defaulted to master</li>
              <li>Convention has changed to be main</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            You can change the master branch name to main with
            <kbd>git branch -m master main</kbd>
          </li>
          <li>Organizations can set a default branch name</li>
          <li>See Link section for article how to rename your master branch</li>

      <h2>Under the Hood</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Under the hood, branches are a Git object type</li>
          <li>
            Branches are represented by a <em>head</em> - a pointer to the
            latest commit in the branches
            <ul>
              <li>Lower case is important since HEAD is something different</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Branches are small files named after the branch name
            <ul>
              <li>Created in the .git/refs/heads folder</li>
              <li>
                It contains a single line, the hash identifer of the current
                commit
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            A repository can have multiple heads - there will be one for each
            branch
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>HEAD</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A reference pointer that points to the current branch you are
            working with
            <ul>
              <li>There will be one in a repository (unlike a head)</li>
              <li>
                This is written in all caps - lower case is something different
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            It defaults to the tip of the master branch of the repository (the
            most recent commit on the main branch of your codebase)
          </li>
          <li>
            You can view the current HEAD by
            <ul>
              <li><kbd>git branch</kbd> with no parameters</li>
              <li>
                <kbd>git status</kbd> displays where HEAD is pointed on the
                first line
              </li>
              <li>
                <kbd>cat .git/head</kbd> - shows the contents of the HEAD
                configuraiton file
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Under the Hood
            <ul>
              <li>This is stored in the HEAD file in the .git directory</li>
              <li>
                Contents of the file will be similar to
                <code>ref: refs/heads/main</code>
              </li>
              <li>
                This is just a reference to the main file in the refs/heads
                folder
              </li>
              <li>
                When you change branches, the HEAD file is updated to refer to
                the new head
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Attached HEAD
            <ul>
              <li>When HEAD points to a branch, it is said to be attached</li>
              <li>
                An attached HEAD points to a branch, which is turn points to a
                specific commit
              </li>
              <li>
                When you commit changes while in an attached HEAD state, Git
                will automatically repoint the HEAD to the newest commit of the
                branch
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Detached HEAD
            <ul>
              <li>When HEAD points to a commit, it is said to be detached</li>
              <li>A detached HEAD points to a commit, not a branch</li>
              <li>
                When in a detached state, any changes you make and commit do NOT
                belong to any branch
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You must use the new commit hash to get back the changes
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

      <h2>Swtiching Branches</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When switching branches the following actions occur
            <ul>
              <li>
                The HEAD file is updated to refrence the new head in the
                .git/refs/heads folder
              </li>
              <li>
                The files in the working directory are updated to match the new
                branch
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            To prevent losing changes, Git will not allow you to switch branches
            when changes will be lost
            <ul>
              <li>Dirty Branch = a branch with uncommitted changes</li>
              <li>
                This includes outstanding changes in working directory and
                staging and untracked files
              </li>
              <li>Commit or stash changes so you will not loose them</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            There is one situation I have found that (on the surface) appears to
            contradict this
            <ul>
              <li>
                Steps to recreate
                <ol>
                  <li>Create a new repository</li>
                  <li>Add a file and stage and commit it</li>
                  <li>Create a new branch and swtich to it</li>
                  <li>Make a modification to the file</li>
                  <li>
                    Switch back to the master/main branch. This is allowed
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>

              <li>
                What is actually going on
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If you look at <kbd>git log</kbd> output, you can see both
                    branches both point to the same commit
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When you create a new branch, it points to the same commit
                    as the original branch
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In this case, you are making modifications to the same
                    commit, so the changes carry over when you toggle between
                    branches
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If each branch points to a different commit, then Git will
                    prevent you from changing branches with outstanding changes
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Allowing the switch would overwrite files since you are
                    switching to a different commit
                  </li>
                </ul>

            Example of creating a new branch from master branch
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create a new_branch pointer using
                <kbd>git checkout -b new_branch</kbd>
              </li>
              <li>
                New_branch points to the same commit as the master branch
                pointer
              </li>
              <li>
                HEAD now points to this new_branch pointer
                <figure>
                  <img src="../../assets/branching-new-branch.png" />
                </figure>
              </li>
              <li>
                As additional commits are made, the
                <ul>
                  <li>New_branch pointer will move to the latest commit</li>
                  <li>
                    The master branch pointer will continue to point to the same
                    commit it did when you created the new_branch pointer
                    <figure>
                      <img src="../../assets/branching-new-branch-2.png" />

                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                A this point, issuing <kbd>git checkout master</kbd> moves the
                HEAD pointer back to the master branch pointer
                <figure>
                  <img src="../../assets/branching-new-branch-3.png" />
                </figure>
              </li>
              <li>
                Since commits are explicitly linked to a branch, commits made at
                this point will only be associated with the master branch. This
                causes a divergence in the project

              <li>
                Similarly, issuing <kbd>git checkout new_branch</kbd> moves the
                HEAD pointer back to the new_branch pointer
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Commits will only be associated with the new_branch pointer,
                    not the master pointer
                  </li>

              <li>
                Without options, this functions the same as

              <li>
                This was introduced to be a lightweight way to switch branches

              <li>Moves the HEAD pointer to the dev branch</li>
              <li>
                This will update the actual files in the working directory to
                match the new branch
              </li>
              <li>Can do other things when parameter is included</li>

              <li>
                This enters a detached HEAD state - HEAD does not point to a

              </li>
              <li>
                CLI will print a warning that you are in a detached head state
              </li>
              <li>
                You can just add the first several characters of the has
                identifier instead (such as 9ad202d)
              </li>
