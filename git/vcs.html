      <h1>General Version Control Information</h1>

      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Software designed to manage changes made to files over time - gives long running history of a software project</li>
          <li>
            Gives you infinite undo/redo functionality
            <ul>
              <li>Files / sets of files can be reverted to any previous versions</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Not a backup system - you must backup and secure the repository</li>
          <li>
            Allows you to juggle multiple versions of the same app at the same time
            <ul>
              <li>Example is a free and premium version of an app</li>
              <li>You could have multiple branches of the same app</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Makes sharing code among a team of multiple developers easier
            <ul>
              <li>Developers can share the same repo so painful integration phases lessened</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Coordinating teamwork
            <ul>
              <li>The repository can be the source of truth for all users, including developers, project managers, and administrators</li>
              <li>This includes bug tracking software, which can link to the bug in the repository</li>
              <li>Project management tools can also link to the repository (Jira)</li>
              <li>Build machines can also link to the repository (Jenkins). It can monitor for changes, compile the code, run metrics and automated tests, and package</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Git
            <ul>
              <li>Open source distributed version control system (VCS)</li>
              <li>Can be used for any text documents as well</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Client / Server vs Distributed Version Control</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client / Server
            <ul>
              <li>Examples include Subversion and TFS</li>
              <li>
                Repository is housed on a central server
                <ul>
                  <li>Clients connect to this central server to get files and commit</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Conflicts must be resolved before commits are allowed</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Distributed
            <ul>
              <li>
                Clients clone an entire repository to thier workstation, including all files, history, etc
                <ul>
                  <li>Git stores the repository in a hidden folder named .git</li>
                  <li>A link is maintained to the server</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>In a peer-to-peer system, all repositories are copies of each other (although there is one version that is designated as central shared)</li>
              <li>
                Advantages
                <ul>
                  <li>You can keep working with version control (making commits, branches, fetching history, etc) offline</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Downsides
                <ul>
                  <li>Cannot lock files (this isn't necessarily a downside)</li>
                  <li>Great for text files, but not good for binary files (lots of version control systems have problems with these)</li>
                  <li>Not user friendly - hard to learn, but easy to use once you understand it</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
