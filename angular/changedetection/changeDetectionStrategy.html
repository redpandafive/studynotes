      <h1>Change Detection Strategy</h1>


      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When not using OnPush, Angular checks all components for updates after event handlers run
          </li>
          <li>
            When using OnPush, components are only checked if they have been marked as dirty by a process such as:
            <ul>
              <li>A bound input changes its object reference</li>
              <li>An Observable bound with async</li>
              <li>A bound Signal emits a new value</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Signal based components are expected to alter the current change detection strategy, primarily
            <ul>
              <li>
                When a component is marked as changed, all ancestors in the component tree are marked as well
              </li>
              <li>
                Marked components are fully checked for changes, even if an update only modifies a small part
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use OnPush custom change detection strategy for a component when you
            are sure the values will only change when the input values change
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not perform heavy computations in templates
            <ul>
              <li>
                Expressions in templates are re-evaluated every time change
                detection gets triggered
              </li>
              <li>
                It does this after an event, re-evaluates all the expressions in
                the templates and compares them with their previous values. If
                there is a change, it will update the DOM
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Caveats:
            <ul>
              <li>For primitives, OnPush will detect changes to inputs since the value has changed and the comparison function picks up on it</li>
              <li>For complex objects (like objects and arrays), the comparison is done by object reference
                <ul>
                  <li>If it isn't a new object, no change will be detected (such as only changing a property, but keeping the original object)</li>
                  <li>It's a good idea to use immutable objects to avoid this since a new object must be created with the changed values</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <h2>ChangeDetection.OnPush Mode</h2>
      <section id="onpush">
        <ul>
          <li>
            You may be able to optimize change detection using the
            ChangeDetection property of a component's configuration so it will
            be in OnPush change detection mode
          </li>
          <li>
            This will only trigger a change detection cycle when we pass a new value
            to any of its inputs, when an event inside the component
            happens, or an Observable fires an event, such as emitting a new object
            <ul>
              <li>
                It can also help to decompose a component when using this
                strategy so that change events within a component do not
                trigger unnecessary re-execution of template expressions
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            This disables the change detection mechanism for subtrees of the
            component tree.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use OnPush custom change detection strategy for a component when you
            are sure the values will only change when the input values change
            <ul>
              <li>Angular will only perform checks on inputs when it detects there is a new reference with the change</li>
              <li>It will not check bound properties on the object from the input, only if the object has a new reference</li>
              <li>Allows you to skip entire entire subtrees during change detection</li>
              <li>
                This will use an equality check to see if the inputs changed.
                </li>
                <li>
                  So, if you have an array as in input and push a new item
                  from the parent component, it will not update since the
                  array is compared by reference.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can force a change using arrayName.slice() to create a copy
                  of the array
                </li>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Signals and RxJS observables allow a component marked for OnPush to participate in a change detection cycle again.
            <ul>
              <li>However, updating a property (such as an error message) from an RxJS stream will not trigger change detection</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, a component that has a large list that only changes
            when the list is pushed into the component
          </li>
          <li>
            Now, the change detection cycle will only run when a new list is
            created
            <ul>
              <li>
                Will not fire when a property on an object in the current list
                is changed
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Gives better performance, but can be a problem if used with mutable
            objects
            <ul>
              <li>
                Since the memory address of a mutable object does not change
                when modifying a property, OnPush will perform change detection
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Angular normally monitors for changes to properties that are
                    referenced
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Inputs passed as observables will not trigger change detection
                since the address of the observable object does not change when
                it emits on object
              </li>
              <li>Avoid using with mutable objects</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Can also combine Immutable.js objects and use OnPush change
            detection strategy
            <ul>
              <li>
                Combining with immutable data structures can bring great
                performance implications for such pure components
              </li>
              <li>New immutable objects will trigger OnPush</li>
              <li>
                Will not introduce a bug since the only way to modify data is to
                create new objects
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If needed, you can manually mark a component to be included in the next change detection cycle
            <ul>
              <li>
                Inject ChangeDetectorRef in the component constructor
                <div class="card">
                  <div class="card-body">
                    <code>
                      constructor(private cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {}
                    </code>
                  </div>
                </div>                
              </li>
              <li>
                Mark the path from the component until the root to be changed for the next change detection run
                <div class="card">
                  <div class="card-body">
                    <code>
                      this.cd.markForCheck();
                    </code>
