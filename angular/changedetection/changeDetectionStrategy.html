      <h1>Change Detection Strategy</h1>

      <h2>Default Behavior</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            By default, Angular checks all components for updates after event handlers run
            <ul>
              <li>It assumes that any event handler can theoretically change any bound data</li>
              <li>After executing event handlers, Angular checks all bindings in all components for changes by default</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            When using OnPush, components are only checked if they have been marked as dirty by a process such as:
            <ul></ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Signal based components are expected to alter the current change detection strategy, primarily
            <ul>
              <li>When a component is marked as changed, all ancestors in the component tree are marked as well</li>
              <li>Marked components are fully checked for changes, even if an update only modifies a small part</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>ChangeDetection.OnPush Mode</h2>
      <section id="onpush">
        <ul>
          <li>
            You may be able to optimize change detection by putting it in OnPush change detection mode
            <ul>
              <li>Set this using the ChangeDetection property of a component's configuration</li>
              <li>This disables the default change detection mechanism for subtrees of the component tree.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            This mode will only trigger a change detection cycle when
            <ul>
              <li>A bound input changes its object reference</li>
              <li>
                An event inside the component marks the component as dirty
                <ul>
                  <li>An Observable bound with async</li>
                  <li>An Observable fires an event, such as emitting a new object</li>
                  <li>A bound Signal emits a new value</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
            <li>Angular will only perform checks on inputs when it detects there is a new reference with the change
            <ul>
              <li>
                It will not check bound properties on the object from the input, only if the object has a new reference
                <ul>
                  <li>An equality check is used to determine if input values have changed.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>For example, if you have an array as in input and push a new item from the parent component, it will not update since the array is compared by reference.
                <ul>
                  <li>It also will not fire when a property on an object in the current list is changed</li>
                  <li>The change detection cycle will only run when a new list is created</li>
                  <li>You can force a change using arrayName.slice() to create a copy of the array</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Signals and RxJS observables allow a component marked for OnPush to participate in a change detection cycle again.
            <ul>
              <li>However, updating a property (such as an error message) from an RxJS stream will not trigger change detection</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            This modes gives better performance, but can be a problem if used with mutable objects
            <ul>
              <li>
                Since the memory address of a mutable object does not change when modifying a property, OnPush will not perform change detection
                <ul>
                  <li>Angular normally monitors for changes to properties that are referenced</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Inputs passed as observables will not trigger change detection since the address of the observable object does not change when it emits on object</li>
              <li>Avoid mutating inputs with this mode</li>
              <li>Can also use immutable objects (such as Immutable.js objects) as inputs with OnPush change detection strategy</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If needed, you can manually mark a component to be included in the next change detection cycle
            <ul>
              <li>Inject ChangeDetectorRef in the component constructor</li>
              <li>Mark the path from the component until the root to be changed for the next change detection run</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="card">
              <div class="card-body">
                <code>
                  constructor(private cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {} <br />
                  ... <br />
                  this.cd.markForCheck(); <br />
                </code>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>

      </section>

      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Use OnPush custom change detection strategy for a component when you are sure the values will only change when the input values change</li>
          <li>
            Do not perform heavy computations in templates
            <ul>
              <li>Expressions in templates are re-evaluated every time change detection gets triggered</li>
              <li>It does this after an event, re-evaluates all the expressions in the templates and compares them with their previous values. If there is a change, it will update the DOM</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>It can also help to decompose a component when using this strategy so that change events within a component do not trigger unnecessary re-execution of template expressions</li>
          <li>
            Caveats:
            <ul>
              <li>For primitives, OnPush will detect changes to inputs since the value has changed and the comparison function picks up on it</li>
              <li>
                For complex objects (like objects and arrays), the comparison is done by object reference
                <ul>
                  <li>If it isn't a new object, no change will be detected (such as only changing a property, but keeping the original object)</li>
                  <li>It's a good idea to use immutable objects to avoid this since a new object must be created with the changed values</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
