      <h1>Change Detection Strategy</h1>
      <section>
        <ul>

          <li>
            When not using OnPush, Angular checks all components for updates after event handlers run
          </li>
          <li>
            When using OnPush, components are only checked if they have been marked as dirty by a process such as:
            <ul>
              <li>A bound input changes its object reference</li>
              <li>An Observable bound with async</li>
              <li>A bound Signal emits a new value</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Signal based components are expected to alter the current change detection strategy, primarily
            <ul>
              <li>
                When a component is marked as changed, all ancestors in the component tree are marked as well
              </li>
              <li>
                Marked components are fully checked for changes, even if an update only modifies a small part
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Use OnPush custom change detection strategy for a component when you
            are sure the values will only change when the input values change
            <ul>
              <li>
                This will use an equality check to see if the inputs changed.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    So, if you have an array as in input and push a new item
                    from the parent component, it will not update since the
                    array is compared by reference.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Will trigger a change detection cycle when we pass a new value
                to any of its inputs or when an event inside the component
                happens
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    It can also help to decompose a component when using this
                    strategy so that change events within a component do not
                    trigger unnecessary re-execution of template expressions
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                You can force a change using arrayName.slice() to create a copy
                of the array
              </li>
              <li>
                Signals and RxJS observables allow a component marked for OnPush to participate in a change detection cycle again.
                <ul>
                  <li>However, updating a property (such as an error message) from an RxJS stream will not trigger change detection</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not perform heavy computations in templates
            <ul>
              <li>
                Expressions in templates are re-evaluated every time change
                detection gets triggered
              </li>
              <li>
                It does this after an event, re-evaluates all the expressions in
                the templates and compares them with their previous values. If
                there is a change, it will update the DOM
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Caveats:
            <ul>
              <li>For primitives, OnPush will detect changes to inputs since the value has changed and the comparison function picks up on it</li>
              <li>For complex objects (like objects and arrays), the comparison is done by object reference
                <ul>
                  <li>If it isn't a new object, no change will be detected (such as only changing a property, but keeping the original object)</li>
                  <li>It's a good idea to use immutable objects to avoid this since a new object must be created with the changed values</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
