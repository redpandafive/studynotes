      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rendering is the process of taking data structures as inputs and
            generating DOM output to diplay to the user
            <ul>
              <li>
                Think of as projecting your data model through a template to a
                visual user interface, resulting in a DOM representation of the
                data
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Where things get challenging is when the data model changes after
            the DOM has been rendered
            <ul>
              <li>
                Updates to the data model must result in updates to the DOM for
                the two to remain synchronized
              </li>
              <li>
                This can be thought of as managing the <em>state</em> of the
                application (synchronizing the app state and the user interface)
              </li>
              <li>
                This invoves state changes, which is a more difficult problem
                that rendering a UI once
              </li>
              <li>
                Accessing and rebuilding the DOM tree is expensive, so changes
                should be kept to a minimum
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

          <li>
            Server side rendering
            <ul>
              <li>
                Changes triggered a request to the server, which responded with
                a new page that the browser will then render
              </li>
              <li>There is no front end state management</li>
              <li>
                Very slow since each change required a trip back to the server
                and a full rerendering of the UI
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            1st Generation JavaScript frameworks, such as Backbone, EXT JS, and
            Dojo
            <ul>
              <li>
                Introduced architecture for seperating your UI code from your
                models
              </li>
              <li>
                Left synchronization up to you - you had to figure out what to
                rerender and how to do it
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Angular JS
            <ul>
              <li>
                Performed dirty checking
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Each rendered data creates a watcher for that particular
                    value
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Whenever anything happens in the app, Angular checks if the
                    value in that watcher has changed from the last time
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        This is called a digest - the process responsible for
                        running watchers
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Pure JavaScript reference equality checks are cheap, so
                        this process runs faster than it sounds
                      </li>
                      <li>DOM access only occurs when changes are detected</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If there was a change, it re-renders the value in the UI
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            React
            <ul>
              <li>
                React uses a virual DOM, a lightweight, pure JavaScript data
                structure of plain objects and arrays that represents a read DOM
                object graph
              </li>
              <li>
                The model data is used to generate this virutal DOM object
              </li>
              <li>
                When the model data changes, a new vitual DOM object is
                generated from scratch
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    This new object is compared to the previous virual DOM
                    object
                  </li>
                  <li>Only components that call setState are compared</li>
                  <li>
                    By diffing the two, it is possible to get a set of
                    differences between the two
                  </li>
                  <li>Only these diffrences are applied to the actual DOM</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                This means React does not try to track changes and maintain
                state. You just re-render the whole UI each time and whatever
                changed will be in the new result.
              </li>

      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Angular triggers change detection based on signals from Zone.js
            <ul>
              <li>
                This captures asynchronous operations like setTimeout, network
                requests, and event listeners
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            On startup, Angular will patch several low-level browser APIs with
            its own versions
            <ul>
              <li>This is done the Zone.js library</li>
              <li>
                Zones are just execution context that services multiple
                JavaScript VM execution turns
              </li>
              <li>
                Generic mechanism to add extra functionality to the browser
              </li>
              <li>
                These modifications give Angular a chance to run change
                detection and update the UI
              </li>
              <li>
                Any API not supported by Zone.js will not trigger a change
                detection cycle
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Examples of browser events that are wired to trigger a change
            detection cycle include
            <ul>
              <li>
                All browser events (like addEventListener)
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    This handles the registration of the callback (as normally
                    done by JS)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>setTImeout and setInterval</li>
              <li>Ajax HTTP requests</li>

      <h2 id="changeDetection">Change Detection Cycles</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each component has its own change detector
            <ul>
              <li>
                Since an Angular application consists of a component tree, this
                means we have a change detector tree as well
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            On each change detection trigger from Zone.js
            <ul>
              <li>
                Angular goes through the whole component tree starting at the
                root component of the application
              </li>
              <li>
                For each component, Angular runs the change detection mechanism
                that is associated with that component and determines if the
                component needs to be re-rendered
              </li>

              <li>
                This process is repeated for all components, from the root until
                leaf components
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2 id="componentChange">Component Change Detection</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To decide if a component needs to be changed, Angular compares the
            current value of each expression used in the template to its
            previous value
          </li>
          <li>
            During this, template expressions are evaluated and several
            lifecycle hook methods are called (such as ngAfterViewChecked)
          </li>
          <li>
            When a change is detected, Angular runs the DOM generating function
            for the component – this produces a new DOM data structure
          </li>
          <li>
            Template expressions bound to a complex object will only be
            considered changed if the bound properties of the object have
            changed
            <ul>
              <li>
                If a property changes on the object that is not bound to an
                expression, the change is not considered (no deep object
                comparison to detect changes)
              </li>
              <li>
                It is not limited to only checking reference comparisons - this
                allows bound property changes to trigger updates
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Situations where change detection can break
            <ul>
              <li>
                Calling a getter from the template that gets its value from
                something like a random number generator
              </li>
              <li>
                Use a random number generator to set a property value during the
                ngAfterViewChecked lifecycle event
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Development mode checks for these types of problems automatically
            <ul>
              <li>
                It runs template rendering twice in a row – if they are
                different an error is thrown
              </li>
              <li>
                Production mode will only run change detection once
                <ul>
                  <li>These errors will not be detected</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

            Change detection can be disabled or delayed
            <ul>
              <li>Think of getting a large data payload via a websocket</li>
              <li>
                In your component,

                  <li>inject a ChangeDetectorRef token into the constructor</li>
                  <li>
