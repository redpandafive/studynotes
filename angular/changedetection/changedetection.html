            Rendering is the process of taking data structures as inputs and generating DOM output to display to the user
            <ul>
              <li>Think of as projecting your data model through a template to a visual user interface, resulting in a DOM representation of the data</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Where things get challenging is when the data model changes after the DOM has been rendered
            <ul>
              <li>Updates to the data model must result in updates to the DOM for the two to remain synchronized</li>
              <li>This can be thought of as managing the <em>state</em> of the application (synchronizing the app state and the user interface)</li>
              <li>This involves state changes, which is a more difficult problem that rendering a UI once</li>
              <li>Accessing and rebuilding the DOM tree is expensive, so changes should be kept to a minimum</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

            Different frameworks handle this in different ways
            <ul>
              <li>
                Server side rendering
                <ul>
                  <li>Changes trigger a request to the server, which responds with a new page that the browser will then render</li>
                  <li>There is no front end state management</li>
                  <li>Very slow since each change required a trip back to the server and a full rerendering of the UI</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                1st Generation JavaScript frameworks
                <ul>
                  <li>Backbone, EXT JS, and Dojo</li>
                  <li>Introduced architecture for separating your UI code from your models</li>
                  <li>These left synchronization up to you - you had to figure out what to re-render and how to do it</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Angular JS
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Performed dirty checking
                    <ul>
                      <li>Each rendered data item creates a watcher for that particular value</li>
                      <li>
                        Whenever anything happens in the app, Angular checks if the value in that watcher has changed since the last time
                        <ul>
                          <li>This is called a digest = the process responsible for running watchers</li>
                          <li>Pure JavaScript reference equality checks are cheap, so this process runs faster than it sounds</li>
                          <li>DOM access only occurs when changes are detected</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>If there was a change, it re-renders the value in the UI</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    React uses a virtual DOM
                    <ul>
                      <li>A lightweight, pure JavaScript data structure of plain objects and arrays that represents a read-only DOM object graph</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The model data is used to generate this virtual DOM object</li>
                  <li>
                    When the model data changes, a new virtual DOM object is generated from scratch
                    <ul>
                      <li>This new object is compared to the previous virtual DOM object</li>
                      <li>Only components that call setState are compared</li>
                      <li>By diffing the two, it is possible to get a set of differences between the two</li>
                      <li>Only these differences are applied to the actual DOM</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>This means React does not try to track changes and maintain state. You just re-render the whole UI each time and whatever changed will be in the new result.</li>
                </ul>

      <h2 id="zone">Angular and Zone.js</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Angular assumes that any event handler can theoretically change any bound data
            <ul>
              <li>After the execution of event handlers, it checks all bindings in all components for changes</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Angular triggers change detection based on events from Zone.js, a library external to Angular
            <ul>
              <li>Provides a generic mechanism to add extra functionality to the browser</li>
              <li>This captures asynchronous operations like setTimeout, network requests, and event listeners</li>
              <li>Zones are just execution context that services multiple JavaScript VM execution turns</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            On startup, Angular will patch several low-level browser APIs with its own versions
            <ul>
              <li>This is done by the Zone.js library</li>
              <li>These modifications give Angular a chance to run change detection and update the UI</li>
              <li>Any API not supported by Zone.js will not trigger a change detection cycle</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Examples of browser events that are wired to trigger a change detection cycle include
            <ul>
              <li>
                All browser events (like addEventListener)
                <ul>
                  <li>This handles the registration of the callback (as normally done by JS)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>setTimeout and setInterval</li>
              <li>Ajax HTTP requests</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Angular provides different strategies for what is done during chance detection
            <ul>
              <li>
                See <a href="changeDetectionStrategy.html">Change Detection Strategy</a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Downsides of Zone.js
            <ul>
              <li>Since browser objects are being modified, errors can be difficult to diagnose</li>
              <li>Zone.js does have a payload penalty.  This can impact lightweight web components</li>
              <li>
                Zone.js cannot monkey patch async and await as they are keywords
                <ul>
                  <li>Angular CLI converts these to promises even if the browser supports async and await natively</li>
                </ul>

      <h3 id="changeDetection">Change Detection Cycles</h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Each Angular component has its own change detector
            <ul>
              <li>Since an Angular application consists of a component tree, this means there is a change detector tree as well</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            On each change detection trigger from Zone.js:
            <ul>
              <li>Angular goes through the whole component tree starting at the root component of the application</li>
              <li>For each component, Angular runs the change detection mechanism that is associated with that component and determines if the component needs to be re-rendered</li>

              <li>This process is repeated for all components, from the root until leaf components</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h3 id="componentChange">Component Change Detection</h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>To decide if a component needs to be changed, Angular compares the current value of each expression used in the template to its previous value</li>
          <ul>
            <li>During this, template expressions are evaluated and several lifecycle hook methods are called (such as ngAfterViewChecked)</li>
            <li>When a change is detected, Angular runs the DOM generating function for the component – this produces a new DOM data structure</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Template expressions bound to a complex object will only be considered changed if the bound properties of the object have changed
            <ul>
              <li>If a property changes on the object that is not bound to an expression, the change is not considered (no deep object comparison to detect changes)</li>
              <li>It is not limited to only checking reference comparisons - this allows bound property changes to trigger updates</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h3 id="devmode">Development Mode Safeguard</h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Situations where change detection can break include:
            <ul>
              <li>Calling a getter from the template that gets its value from something like a random number generator</li>
              <li>Using a random number generator to set a property value during the ngAfterViewChecked lifecycle event</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Development mode adds an addition check for these types of problems automatically:
            <ul>
              <li>It runs the template rendering twice in a row – if they are different, an error is thrown</li>
              <li>This incurs a performance penalty, so development mode runs slower than production mode</li>
              <li>This is done as a safeguard to find change detection loops before during development</li>
              <li>
                Production mode does not add this check
                <ul>
                  <li>It does not have include this check, so it will only run change detection once</li>
                  <li>This gives better performance at the cost of safeguarding against these types of potential errors</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3 id="delaying">Delaying / Disabling Change Detection</h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Change detection can be disabled or delayed
            <ul>
              <li>One use case is getting a large data payload via a websocket</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            You can delay change detection by
            <ul>
              <li>Detaching the change detection</li>
              <li>Set a timeout function for the desired interval</li>
              <li>Enable change detection on the timeout</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            In your component,
            <ul>
              <li>Inject a ChangeDetectorRef token into the constructor</li>
              <li>
                ChangeDetectorRef.detach()
                <ul>
                  <li>Disables change detection</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                ChangeDetector.detectChanges()
                <ul>
                  <li>Enables change detection</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

      <h2 id="signals">Signals</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Signals are simple reactive building blocks
            <ul>
              <li>They hold a value consumers can read</li>
              <li>If writable, the value can be changed and all consumers are notified</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            When a Signal consumer is a template, it can notify Angular about changed bindings
            <ul>
              This type of signal is called a Producer
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Since OnPush uses object references to look for changes, a Signal will need to contain a new object when a value is changed
            <ul>
              <li>An example is a Signal that contains an array of objects</li>
              <li>OnPush will not detect if a new object is pushed to the array that the Signal holds</li>
              <li>To work around this, use a spread operator with the old array to create a new one, then set the Signal to the new array</li>
            </ul>
