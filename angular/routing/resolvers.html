      <h1>Resolvers and Pre-fetching Data</h1>

      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>These can be used to fetch data before navigating</li>
          <li>
            Benefits to using resolvers to pre-fetch data
            <ul>
              <li>Prevent presentation of an empty component</li>
              <li>
                Prevent routing to components with errors, such as empty data
                sections
              </li>
              <li>Can potentially provide a better user experience</li>
              <li>Can be useful if you have a slower HTTP call to get data</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            You have to make a judgment call as to which approach is better
            <ul>
              <li>
                If you have a single HTTP call to get all the data, the resolver
                may be better
              </li>
              <li>
                Its not so clear with multiple HTTP calls in the target
                component, so the resolver may not be the better approach
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Sequence of route transitions without a resolver
            <ul>
              <li>
                Example would be moving from a summary view component to a
                detail view component
              </li>
              <li>
                Once the route is activated (such as clicking a button to
                display the detail data), the detail component is displayed
              </li>
              <li>
                The HTTP data request fires to request the data for the detail
                view component
              </li>
              <li>
                Once the data returns from the server, the detail view will
                display the data
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Sequence of route transitions with a resolver
            <ul>
              <li>
                When the button is pressed to display the detail data, the HTTP
                call to the server will be executed before the route is
                activated and the detail component is loaded
              </li>
              <li>
                When the HTTP request returns, the route activates and the
                detail component is shown
              </li>
              <li>
                The detail component is displayed with all the expected data
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Resolvers are implemented as services
            <ul>
              <li>Should have an Injectable tag</li>
              <li>
                Class must implement the Resolve class from @angular/router
              </li>
              <li>Must implement a method named resolve</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            You do not explicitly need to subscribe to your data service within
            the resolver – Angular does it automatically
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div>
          <p>
            dataService is our custom service class – you do not need to
            explicitly subscribe to it, Angular handles that for you
          </p>
          <p>
            The of call creates an observable to wrap around the error object
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">
            <code>
              export class BooksResolverService implements
              Resolve&lt;Book&#91;&#93; | BookTrackerError&gt; {<br />
              constructor(private dataService: DataService) {}<br />
              resolve(route: ActivatedRouteSnap, state:
              RouterStateSnapshot):Observable&lt;Book&#91;&#93; |
              BookTrackerError&gt; {<br />
              return this.dataService.getAllBooks()<br />
              .pipe(<br />
              catchError(err =&gt; of(err)<br />
              )<br />
              }<br />
              }
            </code>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          To use this resolver, add a resolve property to the route where you
          want this to trigger. The resolve property takes an object literal –
          it contains the name of the resolved data as well as the resolver
          class that should be used to fetch it.
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">
            <code>
              { path: 'dashboard', component: DashboardComponent, resolve: {<br />
              resolvedBooks: BooksResolverService }<br />
              }
            </code>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          In the component, Angular will handle subscribing and making the call
          to the service through the router – you don’t need to add any code to
          do this. You will need to inject the ActivatedRoute object from
          router. Finally, assign the data to a property on your component using
          the name you configured on the route. Since you could get a data
          object or an error, check the type of the property to perform the
          appropriate action
        </div>
        <div class="card">

            <code>
              let resolvedData: Book&#91;&#93; | BookTrackerError =
              this.route.snapshot.data&#91;'resolvedBooks'&#93;;
