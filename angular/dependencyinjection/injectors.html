      <h1>Injectors</h1>
      
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Angular cannot inject a class anywhere until you configure an
            Angular dependency injector with a provider of that service
            <ul>
              <li>
                The injector is responsible for creating service instances and
                injecting them into classes
              </li>
              <li>
                Angular creates injectors for you as it executes the app,
                staring with the root injector that it creates during the
                bootstrap process
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    This is an application wide injector, so you don’t
                    necessarily need to create more than this
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                An injector maintains a container of service instances that it
                has created
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    When a requested service does not exist in the container,
                    the injector makes one using the registered provider and
                    adds it to the injector before returning the service to
                    Angular
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Injectors are inherited, which mean if a given injector cannot
            resolve a dependency, it asks the parent injector to resolve it
            (hierarchical injection system)
            <ul>
              <li>
                A component can get services from its own injector, from the
                injectors of its component ancestors, from the injector of its
                parent NgModule, or from the root injector (injector bubbling)
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Use @Host to prevent this bubbling behavior; for instance,
                    if a component is used multiple times and each should have
                    its own version of a service
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Constructor(@Host myServ: MyService)
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Use @Self in a component to only look within the component
                    injector
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Use @SkipSelf to look in any ancestor component injectors
                    for a dependency
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                Services are singletons within the scope of an injector, so
                there is only one instance of a service in a given injector
              </li>
              <li>
                Nested injectors can create their own service instances
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A child injector is created when a component is created that
                    has a providers metadata item specified
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A child injector is also created when a new NgModule is lazy
                    loaded at run time
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When NgModules or components are destroyed, Angular also
                    destroys that injector and that injector’s service instances
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            Injectors can be configured with providers at different levels of
            your app, by setting a metadata value in one of three places
            <ul>
              <li>
                The @Injectable() decorator for the service itself
                <div class="card">
                  <div class="card-body">
                    <code> .. { providedIn: &quot;root&quot; } .. </code>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Uses the providedIn metadata option where you can specify
                    the provider of a decorated service class with the root
                    injector, or with the injector for a specific NgModule
                  </li>
                  <li>Angular CLI will set this up by default</li>
                  <li>
                    This allows Angular to optimize an app by removing the
                    service form the compiled application if it isn’t used (tree
                    shaking)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                The @NgModule() decorator for an NgModule
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Uses the providers metadata option where you can configure
                    providers for NgModule level or component level injectors
                  </li>
                  <li>Makes it available to all components in the NgModule</li>
                  <li>
                    The single instance is used for all components in the module
                  </li>
                  <li>Using this will mean it is not tree shakable</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                The @Component() decorator for a component
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Uses the providers property of the @Component metadata
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Registering at the component level means you get a new
                    instance of the service with each new instance of that
                    component
                  </li>
                  <li>.. providers; [ HeroService ] ..</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Root injector
            <ul>
              <li>This is the only root injector for the application</li>
              <li>Used when registering at the root or AppModule level</li>
              <li>
                Every class that uses a service registered here will the same
                instances unless you configure another provider with a child
                injector
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
