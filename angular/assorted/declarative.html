      <h1>Declarative / Reactive Coding in Angular</h1>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Writing declarative and reactive code in Angular can simplify and reduce component code
            <ul>
              <li>Benefits to declarative coding really shines the more complex your Angular code becomes</li>
              <li>Improved performance, handles state, simplifies code</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Howerver, there are times when an imperative solution is easier to understand</li>
          <li>
            Angular uses RxJS extensively; it is intended to be used reactively.
            <ul>
              <li>If you are using it imperatively, it is going against the grain.</li>
              <li>With RxJS, as soon as you subscribe to something to pull data out of a stream, you are coding imperatively</li>
              <li>The flow of a stream, and merging streams together into new streams that create new results, is the key concept behind reactive/declarative programming with RxJS.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Going Reactive</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Work with and bind to Observables directly</li>
          <li>Setup RxJS pipelines that levereage operators</li>
          <li>Define reactive streams to react to user actions</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Recommendations</h2>

      <h3>Async Pipe in Tempaltes</h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            See <a href="../pipes/async.html">Async</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h3>Minimize Subscribe Calls</h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Work with streams in your component, not necessarily the data results that are emitted from Observables</li>
          <li>Once you subscribe you are manually pulling data out of the stream, rather than composing streams together to get the results you want automatically.</li>
          <li>This doesn't mean you should never use subscribe, but first ask yourself if you really need to subscribe at that point in the code</li>
          <li>
            For instance, the following approach in the component is more of an imperative approach
            <ul>
              <li>In ngOnInit, manually subscribe to an observable that is returned by a service</li>
              <li>When the values arrive from the service, manually set properties on the component with the new values</li>
              <li>Templates directly reference this property</li>
              <li>Must manually unsubscribe from the observable</li>
              <li>Burden on updating the properties in the component that the tempalte uses to display data will be on the component</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            A more declarative approach would
            <ul>
              <li>Assign the observable from the service as a property on the component</li>
              <li>If you need to calculate a value from the above Observable, you can create a second Observable property on the component that uses RxJS operators to manipulate the values</li>
              <li>
                In the template
                <ul>
                  <li>Use the async pipe to bind to the observable</li>
                  <li>This will automatically handle subscriptions</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Ideally, Angular would be handling the subscribe / unsubscribe automatically for you with the async pipe in the temaplate
            <ul>
              <li>Focus on working with streams themselves, not necessarily the data that they produce</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h3>Use Async Data Pipe in Templates</h3>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Eliminates subscribes and unsubscribes in the component</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          The following snippet will disable the button until the observable emits a true value
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <code>&lt;button *ngIf="canPurchage$ | async as canPurchase" [disabled]="!canPurchase"&gt; Buy Now &lt;/button&gt;</code>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
