      <h2 id="uniflow">Uniflow of Data</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Uniflow of data in Angular is view model data that gets passed to
            the View to be rendered on the screen
          </li>
          <li>
            Templates are generated to the browser by Angular
            <ul>
              <li>
                Angular does not generate HTML as a string when interpreting a
                template
              </li>
              <li>
                Angular directly generates DOM data structures from the data via
                a component renderer
              </li>
              <li>
                This renderer is a function that builds the DOM data structures
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The Angular compiler generates the renderer function at different
            times depending on which mode it is running in
            <ul>
              <li>
                JIT mode
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    These functions are generated at the application startup in
                    the browser
                  </li>
                  <li>Compiler must be shipped to the browser</li>
                  <li>
                    Must wait for this compilation to finish before being able
                    to display data on the screen
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                AOT mode
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Renderer function for a component is generated at build
                    time, not application startup time
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This is more efficient since
                    <ul>
                      <li>Don't need to ship the compiler to the browser</li>
                      <li>
                        Faster since compilation is done at build time, not at
                        runtime
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Unidirectional data flow is the flow of application data going from
            the component classes into the output DOM data structures generated
            by the rendering process (during the rendering process)
            <ul>
              <li>
                What we want to avoid is further modification of data during the
                view generation process
              </li>
              <li>
                Generating DOM data structures should not itself cause further
                modifications of data
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If this occurred, you could be left with a situation where
                    you must
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Repeat this process multiple times until the data
                        stabilizes
                        <ul>
                          <li>This leads to performance problems</li>
                          <li>AngularJS ran into this with digest cycles</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Leave the data and the view in an inconsistent state
                        where the view after rendering does not reflect the
                        actual state of the data
                        <ul>
                          <li>Leads to difficult to use application</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>

      <h2 id="mechanism">Angular Change Detection Mechanism</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This is a built in framework feature that ensures automatic
            synchronization between the data of a component and the HTML of its
            template
          </li>
          <li>
            On startup, Angular will patch several low-level browser APIs with
            its own versions
            <ul>
              <li>This is done by a library called Zone.js</li>
              <li>
                Zones are just execution context that services multiple
                JavaScript VM execution turns
              </li>
              <li>
                Generic mechanism to add extra functionality to the browser
              </li>
              <li>
                These modifications give Angular a chance to run change
                detection and update the UI
              </li>
              <li>
                Any API not supported by Zone.js will not trigger a change
                detection cycle
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Examples of browser events that are wired to trigger a change
            detection cycle include
            <ul>
              <li>
                All browser events (like addEventListener)
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    This handles the registration of the callback (as normally
                    done by JS)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>setTImeout and setInterval</li>
              <li>Ajax HTTP requests</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            On each change detection trigger
            <ul>
              <li>
                Angular goes through the whole component tree starting at the
                root component of the application
              </li>
              <li>
                For each component, Angular runs the change detection mechanism
                that is associated with that component and determines if the
                component needs to be re-rendered
              </li>
              <li>
                To decide this, it compares the current value of each expression
                used in the template to its previous value
              </li>
              <li>
                When a change is detected, the component needs to be
                re-rendered.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Angular runs the DOM generating function for the component â€“
                    this produces a new DOM data structure
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    During this, template expressions are evaluated, and
                    lifecycle hooks are called
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                Template expressions bound to a complex object will only be
                considered changed if the bound properties of the object have
                changed
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If a property changes on the object that is not bound to an
                    expression, the change is not considered
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Does not do deep object comparison to detect changes
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It is not limited to only checking reference comparisons -
                    this allows bound property changes to trigger updates
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                This process is repeated for all components, from the root until
                leaf components
              </li>
              <li>
                For each component, several lifecycle methods are called (such
                as ngAfterViewChecked)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <li>
          Situations where this can break
          <ul>
            <li>
              Calling a getter from the template that gets its value from
              something like a random number generator
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a random number generator to set a property value during the
              ngAfterViewChecked lifecycle event
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Development mode checks for these types of problems automatically
          <ul>
            <li>
              It runs template rendering twice in a row â€“ if they are different
              an error is thrown
            </li>
            <li>
              Production mode will only run change detection once
              <ul>
                <li>These errors will not be detected</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Change detection can be disabled or delayed
          <ul>
            <li>Think of getting a large data payload via a websocket</li>
            <li>
              In your component,
              <ul>
                <li>inject a ChangeDetectorRef token into the constructor</li>
                <li>
                  ChangeDetectorRef.detach()
                  <ul>
                    <li>Disables change detection</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  ChagneDetector.detectChanges()
                  <ul>
                    <li>Enables change detection</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can delay change detection by
                  <ul>
                    <li>Detaching the change detection</li>
                    <li>Set a timeout function for the desired interval</li>
                    <li>Enable change detection on the timeout</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          See Angular university blogs for source of this section
        </li>
      </section>

      <h2 id="onpush">OnPush Mode</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You may be able to optimize change detection using the
            ChangeDetection property of a component's configuration so it will
            be in OnPush change detection mode
          </li>

          <li>
            This disables the change detection mechanism for subtrees of the
            component tree.
          </li>
          <li>
            This mode will make the change detection perform only when the
            component has received different inputs
            <ul>
              <li>It does this by comparing the inputs by references</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            For example, a component that has a large list that only changes
            when the list is pushed into the component
            <div class="card">
              <div class="card-body">
                <code>
                  @Component({ ...changeDetection:
                  ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush... })
                </code>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Now, the change detection cycle will only run when a new list is
            created
            <ul>
              <li>
                Will not fire when a property on an object in the current list
                is changed
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            With OnPush mode, a change will be detected when:
            <ul>
              <li>input properties change</li>
              <li>when the component fires an event</li>
              <li>
                when an Observable fires an event, such as emitting a new object
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Gives better performance, but can be a problem if used with mutable
            objects
            <ul>
              <li>
                Since the memory address of a mutable object does not change
                when modifying a property, OnPush will perform change detection
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Angular normally monitors for changes to properties that are
                    referenced
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Inputs passed as observables will not trigger change detection
                since the address of the observable object does not change when
                it emits on object
              </li>
              <li>Avoid using with mutable objects</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Can also combine Immutable.js objects and use OnPush change
            detection strategy
            <ul>

                Combining with immutable data structures can bring great

                create new objects

            Pipes use a different change detection algorithm
            <ul>
              <li>
                When a pipe involved with a collection (such as an array),
                Angular will only trigger a change detection cycle with the
                referenced array is set to a different object, not if elements
                are added or removed
                <ul>
                  <li>Reference to the object must change</li>
                  <li>Will not respond to object mutations</li>
