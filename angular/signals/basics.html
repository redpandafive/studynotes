      <h1>Signal Basics</h1>

      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Effectively a value + change notification
            <ul>
              <li>Wrapper around a value that can notify interested consumers when that value changes</li>
              <li>Can contain nay value, from simple primitives to complex data struture</li>
              <li>Side effect free, so reading it will not trigger side effects</li>
              <li>
                Helps make code more reactive
                <ul>
                  <li>Signals can be referenced in templates and use Angular's change detection mechanism to update the display with changes</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            They bring a guarantees that when a value is read from it, the entire graph is consistent
            <ul>
              <li>Primarily concerned with maintaining the state of all signals in the system</li>
              <li>They do not give a guarantee that you can keep track of every value that signal has as it changes over time</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Are not a replacement for Events since they do not guarantee there will be a notification for every time a change occurs
          </li>
          <li>
            Use for state management and synchronous operations
            <ul>
              <li>These are an alternative for synchronous coding in Angular to make your code more reactive</li>
              <li>Use RxJS for asynchronous coding; don't use it for state management</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Can be used in
            <ul>
              <li>Components to manage component state</li>
              <li>Directives</li>
              <li>Services to share state across components</li>
              <li>Templates to display a value</li>
              <li>Components that are configured to use ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush. These components will rechecked during a change detection cycle without having to manaully configure it.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            When the signal is updated, anything that depends on it will also be updated
            <ul>
              <li>Kind of like a BehviorSubject in RxJS, but you do not have to subscribe to get a value out</li>
              <li>This creates a dependency graph</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Important to note that it doesn't emit values like Observables. It notifies consumers that it has changed, but its up to the consumer to read the value out of it.
          </li>
          <li>Signals are only concerned with keeping track of the current state and not concerned about any past values
            <ul>
              <li>Three very rapid signal changes does not necessarily equate to three notification to subscribers</li>
              <li>The final value after the three changes is the main concern, not the values after the first and second changes</li>
            </ul> 
          </li>
          <li>
            There is a proposal to bring this to JavaScript as native item since all major frameworks (except React) use this concept
            <ul>
              <li>Proposal implements this as a class so it can be extended to accommodate for framework specific implementations </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Observables vs. Signals</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Observables
            <ul>
              <li>Composable functions with guarantees</li>
              <li>Mainly used for event coordination and for cancellation</li>
              <li>Generally stateless = process event and cleanup</li>
              <li>Multiple values = a collection of events or values over time</li>
              <li>Push N values</li>
              <li>Can convert to a Signal</li>
              <li>Simpler in how they are implemented - the complexity lies in the operators used with them</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Signals
            <ul>
              <li>Use Signals for state management since they retain things in memory</li>
              <li>Represents a single value that can change over time</li>
              <li>Read 1 value</li>
              <li>You can convert to an Observable, but this is also avoidable
                <ul>
                  <li>The event that set the signal can also notify the observable</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>More complicated in how they are implemented, but have a simpler external API</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Benefits</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            These can replace Observables in synchronous operations(particularly BehaviorSubjects)
            <ul>
              <li>Simpler since you do not have to subscribe to them</li>
              <li>Handle synchronous reactivity well (value is known and can be set immediately)</li>
              <li>Does not handle asynchronous reactivity well (need to wait some time, such as a HTTP request)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Allow you to limit async pipes in template while keeping code reactive</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Watching for Changes</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>There are two "watching" functions in Angular
            <ul>
              <li>The template and change detection</li>
              <li>The effect function</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Ideally, a signal only contains elements that change together
          </li>
          <li>
            Each signal has an equal function defining when its value is considered to be changed
            <ul>
              <li>This is called after updating the Signal</li>
              <li>Consumers are only notified when this function returns false</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The default behavior is:
            <ul>
              <li>For objects (including arrays), false is always returned</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Always performing a deep comparison can be costly, so always returning false may be the most efficient approach when working with mutable data</li>
                <li>It does lead to more notifications than needed</li>
                <li>If you are using immutable data, you can pass in a custom equals function to modify this behavior:
                  <ul>
                    <li>

                    </li>
                  </ul>that will detect and trigger notifiations only when the object referenced in the Signal </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Otherwise, (strings, numbers, booleans), the result of oldValue === newValue is returned</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Reading a Signal from the Template</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            During template tendering:
            <ul>
              <li>Reading a signal returns the signal value</li>
              <li>It also registers the signal as a dependency of the view</li>
              <li>If the signal changes, the view is re-rendered</li>
              <li>Make sure to put the parentheses in the binding so the value is actually read from the signal</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">
            <code>
              &lt;div&gt;Total: {{ exPrice() }}&lt;/div&gt;
              <br />
            </code>

      </section>

      <h2>Recommendations</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Use signals to synchronously derive state where possible
            <ul>
              <li>This includes using computed signals to create derived values</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Avoid effects propagating state and Signal writes
            <ul>
              <li>
                This can lead to change cycles and infinity loops
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
