      <h1>Secure Shell (SSH)</h1>

      <h2>Basics</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A protocol for securely logging into a remote host and executing
            commands on that host.
          </li>
          <li>
            Offers security features such as secure user and device
            authentication and transmission encryption
            <ul>
              <li>
                Replaces earlier administration protocols, such as telnet,
                remote shell (rsh), remote login (rlogin), and remote copy (rcp)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            SSH software is
            <ul>
              <li>
                Used as the primary remote administration mechanism for many
                operating systems and devices (Linux, Unix, routers, firewalls,
                network appliances, etc)
              </li>
              <li>
                Embedded into a variety of IT, including file transfer, systems
                management, identity management, and privileged access
                management
              </li>
              <li>Integrating hosts and automating their operation</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Current version is 2.0</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>Typical client / server architecture</li>
          <li>
            Session setup
            <ul>
              <li>
                Host A initiates a connection to an SSH server application on
                host B
              </li>
              <li>
                The two hosts
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Negotiate encryption algorithms for their transmissions
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Establish a session key and perform device authentication
                    for the server (host B)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Host A sends client authentication credentials (such as username
                or password) to the server
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Once all this is done, a SSH connection is said to be established
            between the hosts
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>

              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Used to implement a virtual private network (VPN) to protect
                data transmitted between hosts
              </li>
              <li>
                One host may be acting as a gateway for other hosts behind it
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Server Authentication</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Clients perform authentication of a SSH server using public key
            cryptography using either
            <ul>
              <li>Public keys explicity trusted by the client</li>
              <li>Certificates issued by a certification authority</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            An initial trust must be established by the client for the server's
            public key - for automated processes, this usually reviewed by an
            administrator for the automated process
          </li>
          <li>
            Once trust is established, the client adds the server's public key
            to it known hosts file
          </li>
          <li>
            Steps to setup initial trust to a server (Host B)
            <ul>
              <li>User initiates its first login to Host B</li>
              <li>Host A connected to Host B</li>
              <li>Host A sends its public key to Host A</li>
              <li>
                User verifies the correct public key for Host B by comparing it
                against the value received via a different communication channel
              </li>
              <li>
                Host A stores Host B's public key in known hosts file so future
                connections will not need the public key to be verified
              </li>
              <li>
                Host A authenticates Host B's public key and establishes an
                encrypted connection with Host B
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Client Authentication</h2>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>SSH supports several mechanisms for authenticating users</li>
          <li>
            Password Authentication
            <ul>
              <li>
                Keyboard interactive authentication - user sends username and
                password over an encrypted connection
              </li>
              <li>
                Most commonly used for interactive users, less for automated
                processes since passwords must be hard coded in scripts and
                management systems
              </li>
              <li>
                Public key authentication is usually recommended over this for
                automated processes
              </li>
              <li>
                Steps to password authentication process
                <ul>
                  <li>User initiates login to Host B (server)</li>
                  <li>
                    Host A authenticates Host B using the Host B public key
                    stored in users known hosts fie and established an encrypted
                    connection with Host B
                  </li>
                  <li>User is prompted for username and password</li>
                  <li>
                    Credentials are send to Host B over encrypted connection
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Host B authenticates user by verifying the supplied
                    credentials
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Host Based Authentication
            <ul>
              <li>
                Uses a host key that is sent by a client a server to vouch for
                the identity of the user
              </li>
              <li>
                A configuration file (.shosts) can be used with any user account
                on the destination server to specify which users on which hosts
                can log into that account without further authentication
              </li>
              <li>
                Not recommended for automated access since it does not allow
                command restrictions (what can be once once the destination
                server is accessed)
              </li>
              <li>
                Not recommended for interactive users since it does not present
                an interactive login (which is considered best practice)
              </li>
              <li>
                Session initiation
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Administrator for Host B (client) places the public key for
                    Host A (server) in the known hosts file on Host B
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Administrator configures the shosts file to allow user to
                    authenticate form Host A
                  </li>
                  <li>User starts to login to Host B</li>
                  <li>
                    Host A authenticates to Host B using the host key for Host A
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Host B confirms in the shosts configuration that user is
                    authorized to access the target account on Host B from Host
                    A
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Kerberos
            <ul>
              <li></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Public Key Authentication
            <ul>
              <li>
                Can be configured for both interactive users and automated
                processes
              </li>
              <li>
                Uses keys and certificates to authenticate a connection
                <ul>
                  <li>User keys are the most commonly used method</li>
                  <li>
                    User or process on an SSH Client has a user key called an
                    identity key
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The server must have the corresponding public key configured
                    as an authorized key for a user account to which access will
                    be provided
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Any user in possession of the identity key is allowed to log
                    into that user account on the server and perform actions
                    under the privileges configured for the account
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Advantages
                <ul>
                <li>Does not create implicit trust relationships, only expressly defined trust relationships</li>
                <li>Can restrict authentication based on IP address and authorization by limiting what can be done once connected</li>
                </ul>
                
              </li>
              <li>
                Key types
                <ul>
                  <li>Identity keys = public and private keys for user stored on client</li>
                  <li>Host keys = public and private keys for client stored on server</li>
                  <li>Authorized keys = public key for user stored on server
                    <ul>
                      <li>Server administrator can restrict this to only allow authentication from a particular IP address and which commands can be run</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

              <li>
                Steps for authentication
                <ul>
                  <li>User or an administrator generates an identify key (and corresponding public key) for user</li>
                  <li>The Host B administrator (server) stores user's public key as an authorization key in the user account on Host B (server)</li>
                  <li>User starts to login to Host B</li>
                  <li>Host A (client) connects to Host B and attempts to authenticate user to Host B using user's identity key</li>
                  <li>Host B authenticates user using the authorized key stored in users's account on Host B</li>
                </ul>
